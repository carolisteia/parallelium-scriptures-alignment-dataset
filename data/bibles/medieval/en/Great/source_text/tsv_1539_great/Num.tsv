Num.8.15	after that, shall the Leuites go in, to do the seruyce of the tabernacle of wytnesse. And thou shalt cleanse them and waue them,
Num.8.16	for they are geuen and delyuered vnto me from amonge the chyldren of Israel, for such as open euery wombe: euen for the fyrst borne of all the chyldren of Israel haue I taken them vnto me.
Num.8.17	For all the fyrstborne of the chyldren of Israel are myne both man and beest: sens the daye that I smote euery fyrst borne in the lande of Egypte, I sanctifyed them for my selfe:
Num.8.18	and I haue taken the Leuites for all the fyrst borne of the chyldren of Israel,
Num.8.19	and haue geuen the Leuites as a gyfte vnto Aaron Ꟶ hys sonnes from amonge the chyldren of Israel, to do the seruyce of the chyldren of Israel in the Tabernacle of wytnesse, to make an attonement for the chyldren of Israel, that there be no plage amonge the chyldren of Israel, yf the chyldren of Israel come nye vnto the holy thynges.
Num.8.20	And Moses and Aaron and all the congregacyon of che chyldren of Israel dyd with the Leuytes, accordynge vnto all that the Lorde commaunded Moses concernynge the Leuytes: euen so dyd the chyldren of Israel vnto them.
Num.8.21	And the Leuites were purifyed, and washed their clothes. And Aaron waued them before the Lorde, and made an attonement for them, and cleansed them.
Num.8.22	After that went the Leuytes into do theyr seruyce in the tabernacle of wytnesse, before Aaron and hys sonnes: as the Lord had commaunded Moses concernynge the Leuytes, euen so they dyd vnto them.
Num.8.23	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses sayinge:
Num.8.24	thys is it that belongeth vnto the Leuytes: from .xxv. yere vpwarde they shall go in to wayte vpon the seruyce of the tabernacle of wytnesse,
Num.8.25	and from the age of fyftye yeare, they shall ceasse waytynge vpon the seruice therof, Ꟶ shall serue no moare:
Num.8.26	but shall mynistre vnto theyr brethren in the tabernacle of wytnesse, to wayte, but shall do no moare seruyce. Thus therfore shalt thou do vnto the Leuites in their watche.
Num.9.1	And the Lorde vnto Moses in the wyldernesse of Synay, in the fyrste moneth of the seconde yere, after they were come out of the lande of Egypte, sayinge:
Num.9.2	let the chyldren of Israel offre Passeouer in hys season:
Num.9.3	euen the .xiiij. daye of thys moneth at euen let them kepe it in hys season, accordynge to all the ceremonyes of it, and accordynge to all the maners therof.
Num.9.4	And Moses spake vnto the chyldren of Israel, that they shulde offer Passeouer,
Num.9.5	and they offered Passeouer the .xiiij. daye of the fyrst moneth at euen in the wyldernesse of Synai: accordynge to all that the Lorde commaunded Moses, euen so dyd the chyldren of Israel.
Num.9.6	And certayne men were defyled vpon the soule of a man, that they myght not offer Passeouer the same daye. And they came before Moses and Aaron the same daye.
Num.9.7	And the men sayde vnto hym: We are defyled vpon the soule of a man: wherfore are we kepte backe, that we maye not offer an offerynge vnto the Lorde in the due season, amonge the chyldren of Israel?
Num.9.8	And Moses sayde vnto them: Stond styll, Ꟶ I wyll heare what the Lorde will commaunde concernynge you.
Num.9.9	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses sayinge:
Num.9.10	speake vnto the chyldren of Israell and saye: If any man amonge you or youre chyldren after you be vncleane by the reason of a coarse, or is in the waye farre from you, and will offer Passeouer vnto the Lorde:
Num.9.11	the .xiiij. daye of the seconde moneth at euen let them offre it, and eate it with swete breed and sowre herbes:
Num.9.12	let them leaue none of it vnto the mornynge nor breake any bone of it: But accordynge to all the ordinaunce of the Passeouer let them offer it.
Num.9.13	But the man that is cleane and is not in a iourney, Ꟶ yet was negligent to offer Passeouer: the same soule shall peryshe from hys people, because he brought not the offerynge of the Lord in hys due season: that man shall bere hys synne.
Num.9.14	And yf a straunger dwell amonge you, and wyll offer Passeouer vnto the Lorde, accordynge to the ordinaunce of Passeouer and maner therof, he shall offre it thus: Ye shall haue one lawe both for the straunger, and for hym that was borne at home in the lande.
Num.9.15	And the same daye that the Tabernacle was reared vp, a cloude couered the habitacyon, whych was as a tabernacle of the wytnesse: and at euen there was vpon the habitacyon, as it were the similitude of fyre vntyll the mornynge.
Num.9.16	So it was alwaye, the cloude couered it by daye, and the similitude of fyre by nyghte.
Num.9.17	And when the cloude was taken vp from of the tabernacle, then the chyldren of Israel iourneyed: and where the cloude abode there the chyldren of Israel pitched theyr tentes.
Num.9.18	At the mouthe of the Lorde the chyldren of Israell iourneyed, and at the mouth of the Lorde they pytched. And as longe as the cloude abode vpon the habitacyon they laye styll:
Num.9.19	and when the cloude taryed styll vpon the habitacyon longe tyme, the chyldren of Israell kepte the watche of the Lorde, and iourneyed not.
Num.9.20	And it chaunced that whan the clowde abode a few dayes vpon the habitacyon, they abode in their tentes, according to the commaundement of the Lorde: and they iorneyed also at the commaundment of the Lorde.
Num.9.21	And it happened that whan the cloude abode vpon the habitacion from euen vnto the mornyng, and was taken vp in that morning, then they iorneyed. Whether it was by daye or by night that the cloude was taken vp, they iorneyed.
Num.9.22	Or yf the cloud taryed two dayes or a moneth, or a longe ceason vpon the habitacyon, and remayned theron, the chyldren of Israel abode styll, and iorneyed not. And assone as the cloude was taken vp, they iorneyed.
Num.9.23	At the mouth of the Lorde, they rested in the tentes, and at the commaundment of the Lord, they iorneyed, keping the watche of the Lord, at the commaundement of the Lorde by the hande of Moses.

Num.10.3	Therfore shall they blowe with them, that all the multitude maye resorte to the before the dore of the tabernacle of witnes.
Num.10.4	And yf they blowe but one trompet, then the princes which are heedes ouer the thousandes of Israel shall come vnto the.
Num.10.5	But yf ye trompe, the hostes that lye on the east partes shall go forward.
Num.10.6	And ye trompe the second tyme, the hoost that lyeth on the south syde shall take their iorneye: for they shall trompe when they take their iorneyes.
Num.10.7	But when the congregacion is to be gathred together they shall blowe only, and not trompe.
Num.10.8	And the sonnes of Aaron the preast shal blowe wt their trompettes, Ꟶ ye shall haue them as a lawe for euer in your generacions.
Num.10.9	And yf ye go to warre in your lande against your enemyes that vexe you, ye shall blowe with the trompettes: and ye shalbe remembred before the Lorde your God, to be saued from your enemies.
Num.10.10	Also in the daye of your gladnes, and in your feaste dayes, and in the begynning of your monethes, ye shall blow the trompettes ouer your burntsacrifyces Ꟶ peaceoffringes, that they maye be a remembraunce for you before youre God. I am the Lorde youre God.

Num.10.30	And he answered hym: I wyll not go: but will departe to myne awne land and to my kynred.
Num.10.31	He sayde: Oh naye, leaue vs not: for thou knowest oure mansyons in the wyldernesse: and thou hast bene to vs in steade of eyes.

Num.11.5	we remembre the fyshe which we dyd eate in Egipt for naught, Ꟶ the Cucumbers, and melons, lekes, onyons Ꟶ garleke.
Num.11.6	But nowe oure soule is dryed awaye, for we can se nothyng els, saue Manna.

Num.11.8	And the people went about and gathered it, and grounde it in milles, or bet it in morters, and baked it in pannes, and made kakes of it. And the taist of it was like vnto the taist of an oyle kake.

Num.11.25	And the Lorde came downe in a cloud, and spake vnto hym, and toke of the sprete that was vpon hym, and gaue it vnto the .lxx. elders. And it fortuned that when the sprete rested vpon them, they prophecied, Ꟶ did not ceasse.
Num.11.26	But there remayned two of the men in the hoost: the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the sprete rested vpon them, and they were of them that were wrytten, and went not out vnto the tabernacle, but prophecied in the hoost.

Num.12.1	And Mir Iam and Aaron spake agaynst Moses, because of the woman of Inde which he had taken: for he had taken to wyfe one of Inde.
Num.12.2	And they sayde: Hath the Lorde in dede spoken only thorow Moses? Hath he not spoken also by vs? And the Lorde hearde it.
Num.12.3	But Moses was a very meke man, aboue all the men of the earth.
Num.12.4	And the Lorde spake at once vnto Moses vnto Aaron and to Mir Iam: come out ye thre vnto the tabernacle of witnes, and they came out all thre.
Num.12.5	And the Lorde came downe in the pyller of the cloude, and stode in the dore of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and MirIam: And they went out both of them.
Num.12.6	And he said: heare my wordes. If there be a prophete of the Lordes amonge you, I wylbe knowne of him in a visyon: and wyll speake vnto him in slepe.
Num.12.7	My seruaunt Moses is not so, which is faithfull in all myne house.
Num.12.8	Unto him wil I speake mouth to mouth in a visyon: but in rydels and symylitudes doth not he se the Lord. Wherfore then were ye not afrayed to speake agaynst my seruaunt Moses?
Num.12.9	And the Lorde was moued vnto wrath agaynst them, and he went his waye:
Num.12.10	and the cloude departed from the tabernacle. And beholde, Mir Iam was become leprous, as it were snowe. And Aaron looked vpon Mir Iam, and beholde, she was leprous,
Num.12.11	and Aaron sayde vnto Moses: I besech the my Lorde, put not the synne vpon vs, which we haue folishly commytted and synned.
Num.12.12	Oh, let her not be as one that commeth out of hys mothers wombe, and whose halfe flesh is eaten awaye.
Num.12.13	And Moses cryed vnto the Lorde, saying: Heale her, O God, I beseche the.
Num.12.14	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: If her father had spyt in her face, shulde she not be ashamed seuen dayes? let her be shutte out of the hoost seuen dayes, and after that, let her be receaued in agayne.

Num.12.16	And afterward the people remoued from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wyldernes of Pharan.
Num.13.1	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses saying:
Num.13.2	Sende men out to searche the lande of Canaan, which I geue vnto the chyldren of Israel: of euery trybe of their fathers shall ye sende a man, and let them all be suche as are rulars among them.
Num.13.3	And Moses at the commaundement of the Lorde sent forth out of the wyldernes of Pharan suche men as were all heades of the chyldren of Israel: Their names are these.

Num.13.17	And Moses sent them forth to spye oute the lande of Canaan, and sayde vnto them: get you vp thys waye southwarde, that ye maye go vp into the hye contrey,
Num.13.18	and se the lande what maner thyng it is, Ꟶ the people that dwelleth therin: whyther they be stronge or weake, ether fewe or many,
Num.13.19	and what the lande is that they dwell in, whyther it be good or bad: and what maner of cyties they be, that they dwell in, whyther they dwell in tentes or walled townes:
Num.13.20	and what maner of lande it is: whether it be fat or leane, and whether there be trees therin or not. Be of a good corage, and brynge of the frute of the lande. And it was about the tyme that grapes are fyrst rype.
Num.13.21	And so they went vp, Ꟶ searched out the lande from the wildernesse of zin vnto Rehob, as men come to Hemath,
Num.13.22	Ꟶ they ascended vnto the south, and came vnto Hebron, where Ahiman was Ꟶ Sesai Ꟶ Thalmani, the sonnes of Enack. Hebron was buylt seuen yere before zoan in Egipt.
Num.13.23	And they came vnto the ryuer of Escol, and cut downe there a braunch with one cloustre of grapes and twayne bare it vpon a staffe: and they brought also of the pomgranates and of the fygges.
Num.13.24	And the place was called the ryuer Escol: because of the cloustre of grapes which the children of Israel cut downe thence.
Num.13.25	And they turned back agayne from searchynge of the lande after fourty dayes.
Num.13.26	And they went and came to Moses and Aaron, and vnto all the multitude of the chyldren of Israel, in the wildernes of Pharan: which is Cades, and brought them worde, and also vnto all the congregacion, and shewed them the frute of the lande.
Num.13.27	And they tolde hym, and sayde: we came vnto the lande whether thou sendedst vs, and surely it floweth with mylke and honye: and here is of the frute of it.
Num.13.28	Neuerthelesse, the people be stronge that dwell in the lande, and the cityes are walled and exceadynge greate: and moreouer, we sawe the children of Enack there.
Num.13.29	The Amaleckes dwell in the south contrey, and the Hethites, Iebusites, Ꟶ the Amorites dwell in the mountaynes, Ꟶ the Cananites dwell by the see, and by the coaste of Iordan.

Num.13.31	But the men that went vp with hym, sayde: We be not able to go vp against the people: for they are stronger than we.
Num.13.32	And they brought vp an euell reporte of the lande which they had searched, saying vnto the children of Israel: The land which we haue gone thorowe to searche it out, is a lande that eateth vp the inhabiters therof: and the people that we sawe in it, are men of a greate stature.
Num.13.33	And there we sawe also gyauntes, the chyldren of Enack, which come of the gyauntes. And we semed in oure syght as it were greshoppers, and so we did in theyr syght.
Num.14.1	And all the multitude of the people cryed out, and wepte thorowout that nyght,
Num.14.2	and all the chyldren of Israel murmured agaynst Moses and Aaron. And the whole congregacyon sayde vnto them: wolde God that we hadd dyed in the lande of Egypte, eyther that we had dyed in thys wildernes.
Num.14.3	Wherfore hath the Lorde brought vs vnto thys lande to fall vpon the swearde: and that our wyues, and oure children shulde be a praye? Were it not better, that we retourne vnto Egypte agayne?
Num.14.4	And they sayde one to another: We wyll make a captayne, and retourne vnto Egipt agayne.
Num.14.5	But Moses and Aaron fell on theyr faces before all the congregacyon and multytude of the chyldren of Israel.
Num.14.6	And Iosua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephune (which were of them that searched the lande) rent theyr clothes,
Num.14.7	and spake vnto all the companye of the chyldren of Israel, sayinge: The lande which we walked thorowe to searche it, is a very good lande.
Num.14.8	If the Lorde hath lust to vs, he wyll brynge vs into this lande and geue it vs, which is such a lande as floweth with mylke and honye,
Num.14.9	But in any wyse rebell not ye agaynst the Lorde. Neyther nede ye to feare the people of the lande: for they are but bread for vs. Theyr shadowe is departed from them, and the Lorde is with vs, feare them not therfore.
Num.14.10	But all they which were in that multytude, bade stone them with stones. And the glorye of the Lorde appeared in the tabernacle of wytnesse, before all the chyldren of Israel.
Num.14.11	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: How longe do this people prouoke me, and howe longe will it be yer they beleue me: for all the signes which I haue shewed among them?
Num.14.12	I wyll smyte them with the pestilence and destroie them: and wyll make of the a greater nacion and a myghtier then they.
Num.14.13	And Moses sayde vnto the Lorde: then the Egipcyans shall heare it, for thou broughtest thys people in thy myght from amonge them.
Num.14.14	And it wylbe tolde to the inhabyters of this lande also: for they haue hearde lykewyse, that thou Lorde art amonge this people: and that thou Lorde art sene face to face, and that thy cloude standeth ouer them, and that thou goest before them by daye tyme in a pyller of a cloude, and in a pyller of fyer by nyght.
Num.14.15	If thou shalt kyll all thys people as they were but one man, then the nacyons which haue hearde the fame of the, wyll saye:
Num.14.16	The Lorde is not able to brynge in this people into the lande which he sware vnto them: but hath slayne them in the wildernesse.
Num.14.17	And nowe I besech the, let the power of my Lorde be greate, accordyng as thou hast spoken, saying:
Num.14.18	the Lorde is longe yer he be angrye, and full of mercy, and suffereth iniquitie, and synne, and leaueth no man innocent, and visiteth the vnryghteousnesse of the fathers vpon the chyldren, in the third and fourth generacyon:
Num.14.19	be mercyfull I beseche the vnto the synne of thys people, accordynge vnto thy greate mercye, as thou hast forgeuen this people from Egipt, euen vntyll nowe.
Num.14.20	And the Lorde sayde: I haue forgeuen it, according to thy request.
Num.14.21	But as truly as I lyue, all the erth shalbe fylled wt the glorye of the Lorde.
Num.14.22	But all those men which haue sene my glory and my miracles which I dyd in Egipt and in the wildernes and haue tempted me nowe thys .x. tymes, and will not herken vnto my voyce,
Num.14.23	shall not se the lande which I sware vnto their fathers: nether shall any of them that prouoked me se it.
Num.14.24	But my seruaunt Caleb: with whom there was another maner of sprete: and because he hath folowed me vnto the vtmost, hym will I brynge into the lande whiche he hath walked in, and his seed shall inheret it,
Num.14.25	and also the Amalekites Ꟶ Cananites whiche dwell in the playne contreye. Tomorowe turne you, and get you into the wildernesse: euen by the waye of the redd see.
Num.14.26	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses Ꟶ Aaron, saying:
Num.14.27	howe longe doth this euell multitude murmur agaynst me?
Num.14.28	I haue heard the murmuringes of the chyldren of Israel with the which they murmur agaynst me. Tell them therfore: As truly as I lyue (sayth the Lorde) I will do vnto you, euen as ye haue spoken in myne eares.
Num.14.29	Youre carkasses shall lye in this wildernes. And all you that were tolde thorowout your nombres, from .xx. yeare and aboue (which haue murmured against me)
Num.14.30	shalt not come into the land, ouer which I lyfted vp myne hande, to make you dwell therin, saue Caleb the sonne of Iephune, and Iosua the sonne of Nun.
Num.14.31	But your children which ye saye shulde be a praye, them I will bring in, Ꟶ they shall knowe the land which ye haue refused,
Num.14.32	and your carkasses shall lye in this wyldernesse.
Num.14.33	And your children shall wander in this wildernes .xl. yeres, Ꟶ suffer for your whordom, vntyll your carkasses be wasted in the wildernes,
Num.14.34	after the nombre of the dayes in which ye searched out the lande euen fourty daies, euery daye for a yeare shall ye beare your vnrighteousnes euen .xl. yeare, and ye shall knowe my displeasure.
Num.14.35	I the Lorde haue sayde that I wyll do it vnto all thys euell congregacion that are gathered together agaynst me. For in this wildernes they shalbe consumed, and here they shall dye.
Num.14.36	And the men which Moses sent to search the lande, Ꟶ which (when they came agayne) made all the people to murmure before hym, and brought vp a sclaunder vpon the lande,
Num.14.37	euen those men that did bring vp that sclaunder vpon it, as though it had bene euell dyed in a greate plage before the Lord.
Num.14.38	But Iosua the sonne of Nun Ꟶ Calleb the sonne of Iephune which were of the men that wente to search the lande, lyued styll.
Num.14.39	And Moses tolde these sayinges vnto all the chyldren of Israel, and the people toke great sorowe.
Num.14.40	And they rose vp early in the morninge, and gat them vp into the toppe of the mountayne, sayinge: lo, we be here, and wyll go vp vnto the place of which the Lorde sayde vnto vs, for we haue synned.
Num.14.41	And Moses sayde: wherfore wyll ye go on thys maner, beyonde the worde of the Lorde? it will not come well to passe:
Num.14.42	go not vp therfore: (for the Lorde is not amonge you) that ye be not slayne before your enemyes.
Num.14.43	For the Amaleckytes and the Cananites are there before you, and ye will fall vpon the sweard, because ye are turned awaye from the Lord, and and the Lorde will not be with you.
Num.14.44	But they presumed obstinatly to go vp into the hyll top. Neuerthelater, the arck of the testament of the Lorde, and Moses departed not out of the hoost.
Num.14.45	Then the Amaleckites and the Cananites which dwelt in that hyll, came downe, and smote them, and hewed them euen vnto Horma.
Num.15.1	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, sayinge:
Num.15.2	speake vnto the children of Israel and saye vnto them: when ye be come into the lande of your habitacions, which I geue vnto you,
Num.15.3	Ꟶ wyll offer an offerynge vnto the Lorde. Namely, a burntoffering or a speciall sacrifyce, eyther of a vowe or of a wyllinge mynde, and in youre princypall feastes, to make a swete fauoure vnto the Lorde, of the oxen or of the flocke.
Num.15.4	Then lett hym that offereth hys offeryng vnto the Lorde, bring also a meatofferinge of a tenth deale of floure, myngled wt the fourth parte of an hin of oyle,
Num.15.5	Ꟶ the fourth part of an hin of wyne for a drynckoffering, and offer with the burntofferyng or any other offeryng: when it is a lambe.
Num.15.6	Or yf it be a ram, thou shalt offer for a meate offerynge, two tenth deales of floure, myngled with the thyrd part of an hin of oyle:
Num.15.7	and for a drinkofferynge, thou shalt offer the thyrde parte of an hyn of wyne for a swete sauoure vnto the Lorde.
Num.15.8	And when thou offerest a bullocke for a burntoffring or for a speciall vowe or peace offering vnto the Lorde,
Num.15.9	let him bring with a bullock a meateoffering of .iij. tenth deales of floure myngled with halfe an hin of oyle. And thou shalt bryng for a drinckofferynge euen halfe an hin of wyne,
Num.15.10	for an offering of a swete sauoure vnto the Lorde.
Num.15.11	After thys maner, shall it be done for an oxe, or for a ram, or for a lambe or a kyd.
Num.15.12	Loke what nombre thou makest in these, such a nombre shalt thou make in them also. And according to the nombre of suche offeringes, thou shalt encrease the meatofferynges and the drynckofferinges.
Num.15.13	All that are of your selues shall do these thinges after this maner, to offer an offeringe of swete sauour vnto the Lorde.
Num.15.14	And yf a straunger sogeorne with you, or whoso euer be amonge you in your generacions, and will offer an offering of a swete sauour vnto the Lorde: euen as ye do, so he shall do.
Num.15.15	One ordinaunce shalbe both for you of the congregacion, and also for the straunger. It shalbe an ordinaunce for euer in your generacions, both vnto you and to the straunger before the Lorde.
Num.15.16	One lawe and one maner shall serue, both for you and for the straunger that sogeorneth with you.
Num.15.17	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, sayinge:
Num.15.18	speake vnto the children of Israel, and saye vnto them: When ye become into the lande to the which I bring you,
Num.15.19	then when ye will eate of the bread of the lande, ye shall take vp an heueoffering vnto the Lorde.
Num.15.20	Ye shall take vp a cake of the fyrst of your dow for an heueoffering, as ye do the heueoffering of the barne, euen so ye shall heue it.
Num.15.21	Of the fyrst of your dowe ye shall geue vnto the Lorde an heueoffering in your generacions.
Num.15.22	And yf ye ouerse your selues, and obserue not all these commaundementes, which the Lorde hath spoken vnto Moses:
Num.15.23	euen all that the Lorde hath commaunded you by the hande of Moses, from the fyrst daie that the Lorde commaunded Moses, and hence forwarde amonge youre generacions.
Num.15.24	Yf it happen that ought is commytted ignorantlye of the congregacion, all the multitude shall offer a bullocke for a burntofferyng, to be a swete sauoure vnto the Lorde, with the meatoffering and drynckoffering therto, acdynge to the maner, and an he goate for synne.
Num.15.25	And the preast shall make an atonement for all the multitude of the children of Israel, and it shalbe forgeuen them: for it is ignoraunce. And they shall brynge theyr offeryng for a sacrifyce vnto the Lorde: Ꟶ theyr synofferynge before the Lorde for their ignoraunce.
Num.15.26	And it shalbe forgeuen vnto all the multitude of the chyldren of Israel, and vnto the straunger that dwelleth amonge you: seinge all the people were in ignoraunce.
Num.15.27	If any one soule synne thorow ignoraunce, he shall brynge a she goate of a yeare olde for synne.
Num.15.28	And the preaste shall make an atonement for the soule that synned ignorauntly, with the synneofferynge before the Lorde to reconcyle hym: and that it maye be forgeuen hym.
Num.15.29	And both thou that art borne of the children of Israel and the straunger that dwelleth amonge you, shall haue both one lawe, whoso doeth synne thorowe ignoraunce.
Num.15.30	But the soule that doeth ought presumptuouslye, whyther he be an Israelite or a straunger, the same blasphemeth the Lorde. And that soule shalbe roted out from among his people,
Num.15.31	because he hath despysed the word of the Lorde, and hath broken hys commaundement, that soule therfore shall perish, and his synne shalbe vpon him.
Num.15.32	And whyle the chyldren of Israel were in the wyldernesse, they founde a man that gathered styckes vpon the Sabboth daye.
Num.15.33	And they that founde him gatherynge styckes, brought hym vnto Moses and Aaron and vnto all the congregacyon:
Num.15.34	and they put him inwarde, seyng it was not declared what shulde be done vnto him.
Num.15.35	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: Let the man die: and let all the multitude stone him with stones without the hoost.
Num.15.36	And all the multitude brought him without the hoost, Ꟶ stoned him with stones, and he dyed as the Lord commaunded Moses.
Num.15.37	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying:
Num.15.38	speake vnto the children of Israel and byd them: that they make them gardes in the quarters of theyr garmentes thorow out their generacions, and put vpon the garde of the quarters a ryband of yelow sylke:
Num.15.39	And the garde shalbe vnto you to loke vpon it, that ye maye remembre all the commaundementes of the Lorde, and do them: and that ye seke not after youre awne hert or youre awne eyes: after the which ye vse to go a whoring:
Num.15.40	but ye shall remembre rather and do all my commaundementes, and be holy vnto youre God:
Num.15.41	I am the Lorde youre God, which broughte you oute of the lande of Egypte, for to be youre God. I am the Lorde youre God.
Num.16.1	And Corah the sonne of Iezehar the sonne of Cahath the sonne of Leui, and Dathan Ꟶ Abiram the sonne of Eliab, and On the sonne of Peleth, the sonne of Ruben:
Num.16.2	rose vp before Moses, with other men of the children of Israel, two hundred and fiftye, which were captaynes of the multitude great and famous men in the congregacion:
Num.16.3	Ꟶ they gathred them selues together agaynst Moses and Aaron, Ꟶ sayde vnto them: ye make moche to do, seynge all the multitude are holy euery one of them, and the Lorde is amonge them: Why heaue ye your selues vp aboue the congregacyon of the Lorde?
Num.16.4	And when Moses heard it, he fell vpon his face,
Num.16.5	and spake vnto Corah and vnto all his company, saying: to morowe the Lorde will shewe who are his, who is holy, Ꟶ who ought to approch nye vnto him, and whom he hath chosen to come to him.
Num.16.6	This do therfore, take you fyerpannes, both Corah and all his company
Num.16.7	and do fyer therin, and put cens in them before the Lorde to morowe. And the man whom the Lorde doth chose, the same shalbe holy. Ye make much to do, ye chyldren of Leui.
Num.16.8	And Moses sayde vnto Corah: heare ye chyldren of Leui:
Num.16.9	Is it but a small thinge vnto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the multitude of Israel: and brought you to him selfe, to do the seruyce of the dwelling place of the Lord, and to stande before the multitude, and to minystre vnto him?
Num.16.10	he hath taken the to him and all thy brethren the sonnes of Leui with the, and seke ye the offyce of the preaste also.
Num.16.11	For which cause both thou and all thy companye are gathered together against the Lorde? And what is Aaron, that ye murmur agaynst him?
Num.16.12	And Moses sent, and called Dathan and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab, which sayde: we wyll not come vp.
Num.16.13	Is it a small thynge, that thou hast brought vs oute of a lande that floweth with mylke and hony, to kyll vs in the wildernes, and to raygne ouer vs also?
Num.16.14	Hast thou brought vs vnto a lande that floweth with mylke and hony, and geuen vs inheritaunce of feldes and vyneyardes? Wilt thou pull out the eyes of these men? we wyll not come vp.
Num.16.15	And Moses waxed very angry, Ꟶ sayde vnto the Lorde. Turne not thou vnto theyr offeryng. I haue not taken so muche as an asse from them, neyther haue I hurte any of them.
Num.16.16	And Moses sayde vnto Corah: Be thou and all thy company before the Lorde both thou, they, and Aaron tomorowe.
Num.16.17	And take euery man his censer, and put cens in them, that ye maye offre before the Lorde: euery man of the two hundred and fyftye take his censoure, thou also Aaron, that euery one maye haue his censer.
Num.16.18	And they toke euery man hys censer, and put fyer in them, and layed cens theron, and stode in the dore of the tabernacle of witnesse with Moses and Aaron.
Num.16.19	And Corah gathered all the congregacyon agaynst them vnto the dore of the tabernacle of witnes. And the glory of the Lord appeared vnto all the congregacion.
Num.16.20	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses and Aaron, sayinge:
Num.16.21	separate your selues from amonge this congregacion, that I maye consume them atonce.
Num.16.22	And they fell vpon their faces and sayde. O moost myghtye God of the spretes of all fleshe, yf one man hath synned, wylt thou be wroth with all the multitude?
Num.16.23	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses saying:
Num.16.24	speake vnto the congregacyon and saye: Get you awaye from about the dwellyng of Corah, Dathan and Abiram.
Num.16.25	And Moses rose vp, and went vnto Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel folowed him.
Num.16.26	And he spake vnto the congregacion, saying: departe from the tentes of these wicked men, and touche nothing of theirs: lest ye perysh in all their synnes.
Num.16.27	And so they gate them from the dwellyng of Corah, Dathan and Abiram on euery syde. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stode in the dore of their tentes with their wyues, their sonnes and their lytle chyldren.
Num.16.28	And Moses sayd: Herby ye shall knowe that the Lorde hath sent me to do all these workes, and that I haue not done them of mine awne minde.
Num.16.29	If these men dye the comen deth of all men: or yf they be visyted after the visitacyon of all men, then the Lorde hath not sent me.
Num.16.30	But and yf the Lorde make a newe thyng, and the earth open her mouth and swalowe them vp wt all that they haue: and they go downe quycke into hell: then ye shall vnderstande, that these men haue prouoked the Lorde.
Num.16.31	And it fortuned that assone as he had made an ende of speakyng all these wordes,
Num.16.32	the grounde cloue asonder that was vnder them: Ꟶ the erth opened her mouth, and swalowed them vp, and their houses,
Num.16.33	and all the men that were with Corah and all their goodes. And they and all that they had, went downe alyue vnto hell, and the earth closed vpon them: and they peryshed from amonge the congregacion.
Num.16.34	And all Israel that were aboute them fledd at the crye of them. And they sayd: lest the earthe swalowe vs vp also.
Num.16.35	And there came oute a fyer from the Lorde, and consumed the two hundred and fyftye men that offred cens.
Num.16.36	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying:
Num.16.37	Speake vnto Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the preaste, that he take vp the censers oute of the burnynge, and skatter the fyer here and there,
Num.16.38	for the censers of these synners are halowed in theyr deathes: and let them make of them thinne beaten plates for a coueryng of the aultare. For they offered them before the Lord, and therfore they are halowed, and they shalbe a sygne vnto the chyldren of Israel.
Num.16.39	And Eleazar the preast toke the brasen censers which they that were burnt had offered, and beate them thinne for a couering of the aultare,
Num.16.40	to be a remembraunce vnto the chyldren of Israel, that no straunger which is not of the seed of Aaron, come nere to offer cens before the Lord, that it happen not vnto hym lyke as vnto Corah and hys companye, as the Lorde sayde of him by the hande of Moses.
Num.16.41	But on the morowe all the multitude of the children of Israel murmured agaynste Moses and Aaron, sayinge: ye haue kylled the people of the Lord.
Num.16.42	And it fortuned that when the multitude was gathred agaynst Moses and Aaron, they loked towarde the tabernacle of witnes. And beholde, the cloude couered it, and the glory of the Lorde appeared.
Num.16.43	And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of witnes.
Num.16.44	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying:
Num.16.45	Get you from amonge thys congregacion, that I maye consume them quickly. And they fell vpon their faces.
Num.16.46	And Moses sayde vnto Aaron: take a censer, and put fier therin out of the aulter, and powre on cens, and go quyckly vnto the congregacion, that thou mayest obteyne forgeuenes for them. For there is wrath gone oute from the Lorde, and there is a plage begonne.
Num.16.47	And Aaron toke as Moses commaunded him, and ran into the middes of the congregacion: and beholde, the plage was begonne among the people, and he put on cens, and made an atonement for the people.
Num.16.48	And when he stod betwene the deed and them that were alyue, the plage ceased.
Num.16.49	They that dyed in the plage, were .xiiij. thousande and seuen hundred: besyde them that dyed aboute the busynes of Corah.
Num.16.50	And Aaron went againe vnto Moses before the dore of the tabernacle of witnes, and the plage ceased.
Num.17.1	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying:
Num.17.2	speake vnto the children of Israel: and take of euery prynce of them a rodd, after the houses of their fathers, euen twelue roddes: and write euery mans name vpon his rodd.
Num.17.3	And wryte Aarons name vpon the rodd of Leui: for euery rodd is for a house of their fathers.
Num.17.4	And put them in the tabernacle of witnes, euen in the place where I mete you.
Num.17.5	And the mans rod whom I chose, shall blossome. And I wyll make cease from me the grudgynges of the chyldren of Israel, whereby they grudge agaynst you.
Num.17.6	And Moses spake vnto the chyldren of Israel, and all the prynces gaue hym euery prince ouer their fathers houses, a rod, euen twelue roddes: and the rodd of Aaron was among the roddes.
Num.17.7	And Moses put the roddes before the Lorde in the tabernacle of witnes.
Num.17.8	And on the morowe, Moses went into the tabernacle of witnes: and beholde, the rodd of Aaron for the house of Leui was budded, and bare blossomes and almondes.
Num.17.9	And Moses brought out all the roddes from before the Lorde vnto all the chyldren of Israel: and they loked vpon them, and toke euery man his rodd.
Num.17.10	And the Lord sayde vnto Moses: bring Aarons rod agayne before the witnes to be kepte for a token of the childrens rebellyon, and that their murmuring maye cease from me, and that they dye not.
Num.17.11	And Moses dyd as the Lorde commaunded him, euen so dyd he.
Num.17.12	And the children of Israel spake vnto Moses, saying: beholde, we are wasted awaye Ꟶ consumed: we all come to naught:
Num.17.13	whosoeuer commeth nye the dwellyng of the Lord, dyeth. Shall we vtterly consume awaye?
Num.18.1	And the Lorde sayde vnto Aaron Thou and thy sonnes and thy fathers house with the shall beare the faute of that which is done amysse in the holy place. And thou and thy sonnes wt the shall beare the faute of that which is done amysse in your presthode.
Num.18.2	And thy brethren of the trybe of Leui and of thy fathers housholde thou shalt take vnto the, that they maye be ioyned vnto the and minystre vnto the: euen vnto the and thy sonnes with the before the tabernacle of witnes.
Num.18.3	They shall wayte vpon the and vpon all the tabernacle: onely let them not come nye the vesselles of the sanctuary and the alter, that they and ye also dye not.
Num.18.4	And they shalbe by the, and wayte on the tabernacle of witnes for all the seruyce of the tabernacle, and let no straunger come nye vnto you.
Num.18.5	Therfore shall ye kepe the holy place and the aulter, that ther fall no more wrath vpon the chyldren of Israel:
Num.18.6	beholde, I haue taken your brethren the Leuites from amonge the the childreen of Israel, which as a gyft of yours are geuen vnto the Lorde, to do the seruyce of the tabernacle of witnes.
Num.18.7	Therfore shalt thou and thy sonnes with the take hede vnto your preastes offyce for all thynges that perteyne vnto the aulter, and for all that are within the vayle. And se that ye serue: for I haue geuen your prestes office vnto you as a gyft: and therfore the straunger that commeth nye, must be slayne.
Num.18.8	And the Lorde spake vnto Aaron: behold, I haue geuen the the kepynge of myne heue offerynges of all the halowed thynges of the chyldren of Israel. Euen vnto the, I haue geuen them for the anoyntinge, and to thy sonnes, for a dutye for euer.
Num.18.9	Thys shall be thyne of most holy from the fyre of the altare. All theyr sacrifyces for all theyr meateofferynges, synne offerynges or trespace offerynges, which they brynge vnto me, are most holy. It is thyne and thy sonnes.
Num.18.10	In the most holy place shalt thou eat it: and all that are males shall eat of it: let it be holy vnto the.
Num.18.11	And this also is thyne the heueofferynges of theyr gyftes, thorowe out all the waueofferynges of the chyldren of Israel: I haue geuen them vnto the and thy sonnes, and thy daughters with the, to be a dutye for euer and all that are cleane in thy house, shall eate of it,
Num.18.12	all the fatt of the oyle, and all the fatt of the wyne and of the corne, whyche they shall offre vnto the Lord for fyrst frutes, the same haue I geuen vnto the.
Num.18.13	And whatsoeuer is fyrst rype in theyr lande whych they brynge vnto the Lord, shalbe thyne: and all that are cleane in thyne house, shall eate of it.
Num.18.14	All dedicate thinges in Israel, shalbe thyne.
Num.18.15	All that breaketh the matrice in all fleshe that men brynge vnto the Lorde, whether it be of men or beastes, shalbe thyne. Neuerthelater the fyrstborne of man shalt thou redeme, and the fyrstborne of vncleane beastes shalt thou redeme lykewyse. Those that are to be redemed,
Num.18.16	shalt thou redeme from the age of a moneth, for the value of the money, namely for fyue sycles after the sycle of the sanctuari. A sycle maketh twentye halfpens.
Num.18.17	But the fyrstborne of oxen, shepe and goates shalt thou not redeme. For they are holy, therfore thou shalt sprynkle theyr bloude vpon the alter, and shalt burne theyr fatt vpon the sacrifyce for a swete sauoure vnto the Lorde.
Num.18.18	And the flesh of them is thyne as the wauebrest and the ryght shoulder. These are thyne.
Num.18.19	All the holy heueofferynges whych the chyldren of Israel offre vnto the Lorde, haue I geuen the and thy sonnes and thy daughters wyth the, to be a dutye foreuer: let it be a salted couenaunte for euer, before the Lorde, both vnto the Ꟶ to thy seed with the.
Num.18.20	And the Lorde spake vnto Aaron thou shalt haue none enheritaunce in their lande, nether shalt thou haue any parte amonge them. I am thy parte and thy enherytaunce amonge the chyldren of Israel.
Num.18.21	Beholde, I haue geuen the chyldren of Leui all the tenth in Israel to enheryte, for the seruyce whiche they serue in the tabernacle of witnesse.
Num.18.22	Neither must the chyldren of Israel henceforth come nye the tabernacle of witnesse, lest they beare synne and dye.
Num.18.23	But the Leuites shall do the seruice in the tabernacle of witnesse Ꟶ beare theyr synne, It shalbe a lawe foreuer in youre generacyons, that amonge the chyldren of Israel they possesse none enheritaunce.
Num.18.24	But the tythes of the chyldren of Israel whyche they paye as an heue offerynge vnto the Lorde, I haue geuen the Leuites to enheret. And therfore I haue sayed vnto them. Amonge the chyldren of Israel ye shall possesse none enheritaunce.
Num.18.25	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses saying:
Num.18.26	speake vnto the Leuites and saye vnto them when ye take of the chyldren of Israel the tythes which I haue geuen you of them for youre enheritaunce, ye shall take an heueofferynge of that same for the Lorde: euen the tenth parte of that tythe.
Num.18.27	And thys youre heueoffering shalbe rekened vnto you, euen as though it were of the corne of the barne, or out of the fulnesse of the wyne presse.
Num.18.28	Of thys maner ye shall therfore separate an heueofferynge vnto the Lorde, of all youre tythes which ye receaue of the chyldren of Israel, and ye shall geue ther of vnto the Lord an heueofferynge, whyche shall belonge to Aaron the preaste.
Num.18.29	Of all youre gyftes, ye shal take out all the Lordes heueofferynges euen the fatt of theyr halowed thynges.
Num.18.30	Therfore thou shalt saye vnto them: when ye haue taken awaye the fatt of it from it, it shalbe counted vnto the Leuites, as yf it were the encrease of the corne floore, or the increase of the wyne presse.
Num.18.31	And ye shall eate it in all places, both ye and youre housholdes, for it is youre rewarde for youre seruyce in the tabernacle of witnesse.
Num.18.32	And ye shall beare no synne by the reason of it, when ye haue taken from it the fatt of it: nether shall ye vnhalowe the holy thynges of the children of Israel lest ye dye.
Num.19.1	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses and Aaron sayinge:
Num.19.2	this is the ordinaunce of the lawe whyche the Lorde hath commaunded sayinge: speake vnto the chyldren of Israel, that they brynge the a redd kowe without spot, and wherin is no blemish, and vpon which neuer came yocke.
Num.19.3	And ye shall geue her vnto Eleazar the preaste, that he maye brynge her without the hoste, Ꟶ cause her to be slayne before hys face.
Num.19.4	And let Eleazar the preast take of her bloude with hys fynger, and sprynkle it before the tabernacle of witnesse seuen tymes. And cause the kowe to be burnt in his syghte
Num.19.5	wt hyr skynne, fleshe and bloude. And the dounge of hyr shall he burne also.
Num.19.6	And let the preast take Cedar wodd, and Isope and purple cloth, and cast it vpon the kowe as she burneth.
Num.19.7	Then let the preast wash hys clothes, and he shall bathe hys flesh in water, and then come into the hoste, and the preast shalbe vncleane vnto the euen.
Num.19.8	And he that burneth her, shall wassh his clothes in water, and bathe his fleshe in water, and be vncleane vntill euen.
Num.19.9	And a man that is cleane, shall take vp the asshes of the kowe, and put them without the hoste in a cleane place. And it shall be kepte for the multitude of the chyldren of Israel for a sprenklynge water and for an atonement of synne.
Num.19.10	Therfore, he that gathered the asshes of the kowe, shall washe hys clothes, Ꟶ remayne vncleane vntyll euen. And thys shalbe vnto the chyldren of Israel and vnto the straunger that dwelleth amonge them, a statute for euer.
Num.19.11	He that toucheth the deed body of any man, shalbe vncleane seuen dayes.
Num.19.12	And he shall purifye hym selfe with thys water the thyrde daye and the seuenth daye, and he shalbe cleane. But yf he purifye not hym selfe the thyrde daye and the seuenth daye, he shal not be cleane.
Num.19.13	Whosoeuer toucheth the coarse of any man that is deed, and sprynkleth not hym selfe, defyleth the dwellynge of the Lorde: and that soule shalbe roted out of Israel, because the sprynklyng water was not sprenkled vpon hym. He shalbe therfore vncleane, and hys vnclennesse shall remayne vppon hym.
Num.19.14	Thys is the lawe of the man that dyeth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shalbe vncleane seuen dayes.
Num.19.15	And all the vessels that be open whych haue no lyd nor couerynge vpon them, shalbe vncleane.
Num.19.16	And whosouer toucheth one that is slayne with a swerde in the feldes, or a deed persone, or a bone of a deed man, or a graue: shall be vncleane seuen dayes.
Num.19.17	Therfore, for an vncleane persone they shall take of the burnt asshes of the synofferynge, Ꟶ runnynge water shall be put therto in a vessell.
Num.19.18	And let a cleane persone take Isope and dyppe it in the water, Ꟶ sprynkle it vpon the tent, and vpon all the vessels, and on the soules that were there in, and vpon hym that touched a bone, or a slayne persone, or a deed body, or a graue.
Num.19.19	And the cleane persone shall sprynkle vpon the vncleane the thirde daye and the seuenth daye. And the seuenth daye he shall purifye him selfe, Ꟶ wasshe hys clothes, Ꟶ bathe him selfe in water, and shalbe cleane at euen.
Num.19.20	But the man that is vncleane, and sprynkleth not him selfe, the same soule shalbe destroyed from amonge the congregacyon: because he hath defyled the holy place of the Lorde, and the sprynklynge water hath not bene sprynkled vpon him, therfore shall he remayne vncleane. And thys shalbe a perpetuall lawe vnto them. And he that sprynkleth the sprynklynge water, shall washe his clothes.
Num.19.21	And he that toucheth the sprynklyng water shalbe vncleane vntyll euen.
Num.19.22	And whatsoeuer the vncleane persone toucheth, shalbe vncleane. And the soule that toucheth it, shalbe vncleane vntyll the euen.
Num.20.1	And the children of Israel came wt the whole multitude into the deserte of Sin in the fyrst moneth, and the people abode at Cades. And there dyed MirIam, and was buryed there.
Num.20.2	But there was no water for the multitude, and they gathered them selues together agaynst Moses Ꟶ Aaron.
Num.20.3	And the people chode with Moses, and spake, sayinge: wolde God that we had perysshed, when oure brethren dyed before the Lorde.
Num.20.4	Why haue ye brought the congregacyon of the Lorde vnto thys wyldernesse, that both we and oure catell shulde dye in it?
Num.20.5	Wherfore haue ye made vs to go oute of Egypte, to brynge vs into this vngracious place, which is no place of seed nor of fygges nor vynes, nor of pomgranates, nether is there any water to drynke?
Num.20.6	And Moses and Aaron went from the congregacyon vnto the dore of the tabernacle of witnesse, and fell vpon theyr faces. And the glory of the Lorde appered vnto them.
Num.20.7	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses sayinge:
Num.20.8	take the rodd, and gether thou and thy brother Aaron the congregacyon together, and speake vnto the rocke before theyr eyes, and it shall geue forth hys water. And thou shalt brynge them water out of the rocke, to geue the company dryncke, and theyr beastes also.
Num.20.9	And Moses toke the rodd from before the Lorde, as he commaunded hym.
Num.20.10	And Moses Ꟶ Aaron gethered the congregacyon together before the rocke: and Moses sayde vnto them: heare ye rebellyons, must we fett you water oute of thys rocke?
Num.20.11	And Moses lyfte vp hys hande, and with hys rodd he smote the rocke two tymes, and the water came oute aboundantly, and the multitude drancke and theyr beastes also.
Num.20.12	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses Ꟶ Aaron: because ye beleued me not, to sanctifye me in the eyes of the chyldren of Israel, therfore ye shall not brynge thys congregacyon into the lande whyche I haue geuen them.
Num.20.13	Thys is the water of stryffe, because the chyldren of Israel stroue with the Lorde, Ꟶ he was sanctifyed in them.
Num.20.14	And Moses sent messengers from Cades vnto the kynge of Edom. Thus sayeth thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the trauell that hath happened vs,
Num.20.15	Oure fathers went doune into Egpte, and we haue dwelt in Egypte a longe tyme, and the Egypcians vexed vs Ꟶ oure fathers.
Num.20.16	And whan we cryed vnto the Lorde, he herde oure voyce, and sent an angell, and hath fett vs vp out of Egypt. And beholde, we are in Cades, euen in the vttermost cyte of thy border.
Num.20.17	We wyll go now thorow thy countre: but we will not go thorowe the feldes or vyneyardes, nether wyll we dryncke of the water of the fountaynes, we wyll go by the kynges hye waye, and nether turne vnto the ryghte hande nor to the lefte, vntyll we be past thy countre.
Num.20.18	And Edom answered hym. Thou shalt not go by me, lest I come out agaynst the with the swerde.
Num.20.19	The chyldren of Israel sayde vnto hym: we wyll go by the beaten waye: and yf I and my catell drynke of thy water, I wyll paye for it I wyll but onely (without any harme) go thorowe on my fete.
Num.20.20	He answered. Thou shalt not go thorowe. And Edom came oute agaynst hym with moche people, and wyth a myghtie power.
Num.20.21	And thus Edom denied to geue Israel passage thorow his countre: wherfore Israel turned awaye from hym.
Num.20.22	And the chyldren of Israel departed from Cades, and came vnto mount Hor wyth all the congregacyon.
Num.20.23	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, harde by the coaste of the londe of Edom sayinge:
Num.20.24	Aaron shall be gathered vnto hys people, for he shall not come into the lande whych I haue geuen vnto the chyldren of Israel: because ye disobeyed my mouth at the water of stryffe.
Num.20.25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his sonne, and brynge them vp into mount Hor,
Num.20.26	and thou shalt strype Aaron out of hys vestimentes, and put them vpon Eleazar hys sonne, and Aaron shalbe gathered vnto hys people and shall dye there.
Num.20.27	And Moses dyd as the Lorde commaunded: and they went vp into mount Hor in the syghte of all the multitude.
Num.20.28	And Moses toke of Aarons clothes, and put them vpon Eleazar hys sonne and Aaron dyed there in the toppe of the mount.
Num.20.29	And Moses and Eleazar came doune oute of the mount. Whan all the multytude sawe that Aaron was deed, they mourned for Aaron thyrtye dayes, thorowe oute all the housholdes of Israel.
Num.21.1	And when kynge Arad the Cananite whyche dwelt towarde the south, harde tell that Israel came vp the waye that the spyes had founde oute, he foughte agaynst Israel, and toke some of them presoners.
Num.21.2	And Israel vowed a vowe vnto the Lorde, and sayde: If thou wylt delyuer this people into my hande, I wyll vtterly destroye theyr cyties.
Num.21.3	And the Lorde herde the voyce of Israel, and deliuered them the Cananites. And they destroyed them and theyr cyties, Ꟶ called the name of the place Horma.
Num.21.4	And they departed from mount Hor by the waye of the redd see: to compasse the land of Edom. And the soule of the people faynted by the waye.
Num.21.5	And the people spake agaynst God Ꟶ agaynst Moses wherfore hast thou brought vs oute of Egypte, for to dye in the wildernesse? for here is nether bread nor water, Ꟶ oure soule lotheth thys lyghte breade.
Num.21.6	Wherfore the Lorde sent fyerye serpentes amonge the people, whych stonge them: and moche people of Israel dyed.
Num.21.7	Therfore the people came to Moses and sayde: we haue synned, for we haue spoken agaynst the Lorde Ꟶ agaynst the, make intercessyon to the Lorde, that he take awaye the serpentes from vs. And Moses made intercessyon for the people.
Num.21.8	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: make the a fyrie serpent Ꟶ set it vp for a sygne, that as many as are bytten, maye loke vpon it, Ꟶ lyue.
Num.21.9	And Moses made a serpent of brasse, and set it vp for a sygne. And when the serpentes had bytten any man, he behelde the serpent of brasse, and was healed.
Num.21.10	And the chyldren of Israel departed thence, and pytched in Oboth.
Num.21.11	And they departed from Oboth, and pitched at the heapes of Abarim: euen in the wyldernesse whyche is by the playne of Moab on the east syde.
Num.21.12	And they remoued thence, and pytched vpon the ryuer of zarad.
Num.21.13	And they departed thence, and pytched on the other syde of Arnon, which is in the wyldernesse, and commeth oute of the costes of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, betwene Moab and the Amorites.
Num.21.14	Wherfore it is spoken in the boke of the warre of the Lord, what thynge he dyd in the redd see, Ꟶ in the ryuers of Arnon.
Num.21.15	And the heade of the ryuers, that goeth downe to the dwellyng of Ar, and stretcheth vnto the border of Moab:
Num.21.16	from thence it turneth vnto Beer. The same is Beer, or well wherof the Lorde spake vnto Moses: gether the people together, and I wyll geue them water.
Num.21.17	Then Israel sange thys songe: Aryse vp well, singe ye vnto him.
Num.21.18	The princes dygged thys well, the captaynes of the people dygged it, with the teacher, and with theyr staues. And from the wyldernesse they went to Matana,
Num.21.19	and from Matana to Nahaliel, Ꟶ from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
Num.21.20	and from Bamoth to the valay that is in the felde of Moab vnto the top of the hyll that appeareth before Iesimon.
Num.21.21	And Israel sent messengers vnto Sehon, kynge of the Amorites, sayinge:
Num.21.22	I wyll go thorowe thy lande: we wyll not tourne into thy feldes or vyneyardes, nether drynke of the waters of the well: but we wyll go a longe by the kynges hye waye, vntyll we be past thy countre.
Num.21.23	But Sehon wolde geue Israel no licence to passe thorowe hys countre, but gethered all hys people together and went oute agaynst Israel into the wyldernesse. And he came to Iaheza and foughte agaynst Israel.
Num.21.24	And Israel smote him in the edge of the swerde, and conquered hys lande, from Arnon vnto Iakob: and vnto the chyldren of Ammon. For the border of the chyldren of Ammon was, stronge.
Num.21.25	And Israel toke all these cities and dwelt in all the cyties of the Amorites: in Hesbon and in all the townes that longe therto.
Num.21.26	For Hesbon was the cytie of Sehon the kynge of the Amorites, whyche fought before agaynst the kynge of the Moabites, and toke all his lande out of hys hande, euen vnto Arnon.
Num.21.27	Wherfore they saye in the prouerbe: come to Hesbon, and let the cytye of Sehon be bylt Ꟶ repayred:
Num.21.28	for there is a fyre gone out of Hesbon, and a flamme from the cytie of Sehon, and hath consumed Ar in Moab, and the inheritours of the hye places in Arnon.
Num.21.29	Wo be to the Moab: o people of Chamos, ye are vndone, he hath put his sonnes to flyghte, and hys daughters to captiuyte vnto Sehon kynge of the Amorites.
Num.21.30	Theyr empire is lost from Hesbon vnto Dibon, and we made a wyldernesse euen vnto Nopha, whych reacheth vnto Mediba.
Num.21.31	And thus Israel dwelt in the lande of the Amorites.
Num.21.32	And Moses sent to serche oute Iaezer, and they toke townes belongynge therto, and rooted oute the Amorites that were there in.
Num.21.33	And they tourned and went vp towarde Basan. And Og the kynge of Basan came out agaynst them, he and all his people to fyght at Adrei.
Num.21.34	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses, feare him not, for I haue delyuered him in thy hande, and all his people, and hys lande. And thou shalt do to him as thou dydest vnto Sehon the kyng of the Amorites which dwelt at Hesbon.
Num.21.35	They smote hym therfore, and his sonnes, and all his people, vntill ther was nothinge lefte him. And they conquered hys lande.
Num.22.1	And the chyldren of Israel departed and pytched in the feldes of Moab, on the othersyde of Iordane, ouer against Iericho.
Num.22.2	And Balac the sonne of ziphor sawe all that Israel had done to the Amorites:
Num.22.3	and the Moabites were sore afrayed of the people, because they were many, and stode in feare of the chyldren of Israel.
Num.22.4	And Moab sayde vnto the elders of Madian: now shall this companye lycke vs vp all that are rounde aboute vs, as an oxe lycketh vp the grasse of the felde. And Balac the sonne of ziphor was kynge of the Moabites at that tyme.
Num.22.5	He sent messengers therfore vnto Balaam the sonne of Beor in Pethor (whych is by the ryuer in the lande of the chyldren of his folke) to call him, sayinge: beholde, there is a people come oute of Egypte, Ꟶ beholde, they couer the face of the erth, Ꟶ dwell ouer agaynst me.
Num.22.6	Come nowe therfore Ꟶ curse thys people for my sake. For they are to myghtie for me, yf so perauenture I myght be able to smyte them Ꟶ to dryue them oute of the lande. For I wote that he whome thou blessest, is blessed, and whome thou cursest is cursed.
Num.22.7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Madian departed, hauynge the rewarde of the sothsayinge in theyr hande. And they came vnto Balaam, and tolde him the wordes of Balac.
Num.22.8	He answered them: tary here thys nyght, and I wyll brynge you worde, euen as the Lord shall saye vnto me. And the Lordes of Moab abode with Balaam.
Num.22.9	And God came vnto Balaam and sayde, what men are these wyth the?
Num.22.10	And Balaam sayde vnto God: Balac the sonne of ziphor kynge of Moab hath sent vnto me, sayinge:
Num.22.11	beholde, there is a people come out of Egypt and couereth the face of the erth: come nowe therfore, and curse them for my sake, yf so peraduenture I maye be able to ouercome them in batell, and to dryue them oute.
Num.22.12	And God sayde vnto Balaam: Go not thou with them, nether curse the people, for they are blessed.
Num.22.13	And Balaam rose vp in the mornynge Ꟶ sayde vnto the Lordes of Balac: get you vnto youre lande: for the Lorde wyll not suffre me to go wyth you.
Num.22.14	And the Lordes of Moab rose vp, Ꟶ went vnto Balac and sayde: Balaam wolde not come wyth vs.
Num.22.15	And Balac sent agayne a greatter companye of Lordes and more honorable then they:
Num.22.16	whyche came to Balaam, and told him: Thus sayeth Balac the sonne of ziphor: oh, let nothynge let the, but come vnto me,
Num.22.17	for I wyll greatly promote the vnto greate honoure, and wyll do whatsoeuer thou sayest vnto me, come I praye the, curse thys people for my sake:
Num.22.18	And Balaam answered and sayde vnto the seruauntes of Balac: If Balac wolde geue me hys housefull of syluer and golde, I cannot go beyonde the worde of the Lord my God, to do lesse or moare.
Num.22.19	Nowe therfore tarye ye here thys nyghte: that I maye wete, what the Lorde wyll saye vnto me moare.
Num.22.20	And God came vnto Balaam by nyghte, Ꟶ sayde vnto him: If the men come to call the, ryse vp and go with them: but loke what I saye vnto the, that shalt thou do.
Num.22.21	And Balaam rose vp early, and sadeld hys asse, Ꟶ went with the Lordes of Moab.
Num.22.22	And the countenaunce of God was angrye because he went. And the angell of the Lorde stode in the waye agaynst hym, as he rode vpon hys asse, and hys two seruauntes were with hym.
Num.22.23	And when the asse sawe the angell of the Lorde stande in the waye, and hauynge a swerde drawen in his hande, the asse turned asyde oute of the waye, and went out into the felde. And Balaam smote the asse, to turne her into the waye.
Num.22.24	But the angell of the Lord stode in a path betwene the vyneyardes, and there was a wall on the one syde Ꟶ another on the other.
Num.22.25	And when the asse sawe the angell of the Lorde, she wrenched vnto the wall, and thrust Balaams fote vnto the wall, and he smote her agayne.
Num.22.26	And the angell of the Lorde went forther and stode in a narowe place, where was no waye to tourne, ether to the ryght hande or to the lyfte.
Num.22.27	And when the asse sawe the angell of the Lorde, she fell downe vnder Balaam: and Balaam was wroth, and smote the asse with a staffe.
Num.22.28	And the Lorde opened the mouth of the asse, Ꟶ she sayed vnto Balaam: what haue I done vnto the, that thou hast smytten me nowe thre tymes?
Num.22.29	And Balaam sayde vnto the Asse: because thou hast mocked me: I wolde also there were a swerde in myne hande, for euen nowe wolde I kyll the.
Num.22.30	And the asse sayde vnto Balaam: am not I thyne Asse whyche thou hast rydden vpon sence thou wast borne vnto thys daye? Was I euer wont to do so vnto the? he sayde: nay.
Num.22.31	And the Lorde opened the eyes of Balaam and he sawe the angell of the Lorde standinge in the waye, hauynge a swerde drawen in hys hande. He bowed hym selfe therfore, and fell flat on hys face.
Num.22.32	And the angell of the Lorde sayde vnto hym: Wherfore hast thou smyten thyne asse thre tymes? beholde, I came out as an aduersary, because thou makest thy waye contrary vnto me,
Num.22.33	and the asse sawe me, and went backe fro me thre tymes: or els yf she had not turned fro me I had suerly slayne the, and saued her alyue.
Num.22.34	Balaam sayd vnto the angell of the Lord: I haue synned: for I wist not that thou stodest in the waye agaynst me Nowe therfore yf it displease the I wyll turne home agayne.
Num.22.35	The angell sayde vnto Balaam: go with the men: but, what I saye vnto the, that shalt thou speake. And so Balaam went with the Lordes of Balac.
Num.22.36	And when Balac herde that Balaam was come, he went out to mete hym vnto a cytie of Moab, whiche is in the border of Arnon, euen in the vtmost coast.
Num.22.37	And Balac sayde vnto Balaam: dyd I not sende for the, to call the? And wherfore camest thou not vnto me? because I am not able to promote the vnto honoure?
Num.22.38	And Balaam made answere vnto Balac: Loo, I am come vnto the. And can I nowe saye any thinge at all. The worde that God putteth in my mouthe, that shall I speake.
Num.22.39	And Balaam went wyth Balac, and they came vnto a cytie of stretes.
Num.22.40	And Balac offered oxen and shepe, and sent for Balaam and for the Lordes that were with hym.
Num.22.41	And on the morowe Balac toke Balaam, and brought hym vp into the hye place of Baal, that thence he myght se the vtmost parte of the people.
Num.23.1	And Balaam sayd vnto Balac: bylde me here seuen alters and prepare me here seuen oxen and seuen rammes.
Num.23.2	And Balac dyd as Balaam sayde. And Balac and Balaam offered on euery alter an oxe and a ram.
Num.23.3	And Balaam sayd vnto Balac: stande by the sacrifyce, and I wyll goo yf happly the Lorde wyll mete me: and whatsoeuer he sheweth me, I will tell the, and he went forth alone.
Num.23.4	But God met Balaam, and Balaam sayde vnto hym: I haue prepared seuen alters, and haue offered vpon euery alter, an oxe and a ram.
Num.23.5	And the Lorde put a sayinge in Balams mouth, and sayde: go agayn to Balac and saye on thys wyse.
Num.23.6	And whan he went agayne vnto him, loo, he stode by hys sacrifice, he and all the Lordes of Moab.
Num.23.7	And he toke vp hys parable and sayde Balac the kynge of Moab hath fett me from Mesopotamia out of the mountaynes of the east (sayinge:) come, curse Iacob for my sake: come, Ꟶ defye Israel.
Num.23.8	Howe shall I curse him, whom God hath not cursed? or howe shall I defye him, whom God hath not defyed?
Num.23.9	from the toppe of the rockes I se hym, and from the hylles I beholde hym: loo, the people shall dwell by them selfe, and shall not be rekened among the nacyons.
Num.23.10	Who can tell the dust of Iacob, and the nombre of the fourth parte of Israel? I praye God, that my soule maye dye the death of the ryghteous, Ꟶ that my last ende maye be lyke hys.
Num.23.11	And Balac sayde vnto Balaam: what hast thou done vnto me? I fett the to curse myne enemyes, and beholde, thou hast blessed them.
Num.23.12	He answered and sayde: must I not kepe that Ꟶ speake it, whych the Lorde hath put in my mouthe?
Num.23.13	And Balac sayde vnto hym: Come I praye the with me vnto another place, whence thou mayest se them, and thou shalt se but the vtmost parte of them, and shalt not se them all: curse them out of that place for my sake.
Num.23.14	And he brought him into a felde (where men myght se farre of) euen to the toppe of an hyll, and bylt seuen alters, and offered an oxe and a ram on euery alter.
Num.23.15	And he sayd vnto Balac: stande here by thy sacrifyce, whyle I go yonder.
Num.23.16	And the Lord mett Balaam, and put a worde in hys mouth Ꟶ sayd: go agayne vnto Balac, and thus saye.
Num.23.17	And when he came to hym: beholde, he stode by his sacrifyce, Ꟶ the Lordes of Moab with hym. And Balac sayde vnto him: what hath the Lorde sayde?
Num.23.18	And he toke vp his parable Ꟶ answered: ryse vp Balac and heare, and herken vnto me thou sonne of ziphor.
Num.23.19	God is not a man that he shulde lye, nether the sonne of a man that he shulde repent: shulde he saye, and not doo? or shulde he speake, and not make it good?
Num.23.20	beholde, I haue taken vpon me to blesse, for he hath blessed, and it is not in my power to alter it.
Num.23.21	He behelde no vanyte in Iacob, nor sawe trauayll in Israel. The Lorde hys God is wt him, and the presence of the kyng is amonge them.
Num.23.22	God brought them oute of Egypte, he hath strength as an vnicorne.
Num.23.23	There is no sorcery in Iacob, nor sothsaying in Israel. It is nowe tolde vnto Iacob Ꟶ Israel, what God hath wrought.
Num.23.24	Beholde, the people shal ryse vp as a lyonesse, and heue vp hym selfe as a lyon. He shall not lye downe, vntill he eate of the praye, and drynke the bloude of them that are slayne.
Num.23.25	And Balac sayde vnto Balaam: nether curse them nor blesse them.
Num.23.26	But Balaam answered and sayde vnto Balac: tolde not I the sayinge: all that the Lorde speaketh, that I must doo?
Num.23.27	And Balac sayde vnto Balaam: come I praye the, and I wyll brynge the yet vnto another place: yf peraduenture it shall please God, that thou mayst thence curse them for my sake.
Num.23.28	And Balac broughte Balaam vnto the toppe of Peor, that boweth toward the wyldernesse of Iesymmom.

Num.33.53	And possesse the lande Ꟶ dwell therin, for I haue geuen you the lande to enioye it.
Num.33.54	And ye shall deuyde the enheritaunce of the land by lot amonge your kynredes, and geue to the mo the more enheritaunce, and to the fewer the lesse enheritaunce. And youre enheritaunce shalbe in the trybes of your fathers, euery mans enheritaunce in the place where his lot faleth.
Num.33.55	But and yf ye wyll not dryue oute the inhabiters of the lande before you, than those which ye let remayne of them, shalbe prickes in youre eyes, and dartes in your sydes, and shall vexe you in the lande wherin ye dwell.

Num.34.8	And from mount Hor, ye shall describe youre border, tyll it come vnto Hemath, and the ende of the coaste shalbe at zedada,

Num.34.15	Two trybes and an halfe haue receaued their enheritaunce on the other syde of Iordan, oueragaynst Iericho eastwarde.
Num.34.16	And the Lorde spake to Moses, sayinge:
Num.34.17	These are the names of the men, which shall deuyde the lande vnto you: Eleazar the preaste, and Iosua the sonne of Nun.
Num.34.18	And ye shall take also a Lorde of euery trybe, when ye deuyde the lande.

Num.35.1	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses in the feldes of Moab by Iordan, oueragaynst Iericho, sayinge:
Num.35.2	commaunde the chyldren of Israel, that they geue vnto the Leuites of the enheritaunce of theyr possession, cyties to dwell in. And ye shall geue also vnto the cyties of the Leuites, suburbes hard by theyr cityes rounde about them.
Num.35.3	The cyties shall they haue to dwell in, and the suburbes for theyr catell, and for theyr possession and all maner of beastes of theyrs.
Num.35.4	And the suburbes of the cyties which ye shall geue vnto the Leuites, shall reache from the wall of the cytie outwarde, a thousande cubytes rounde about.
Num.35.5	And ye shall measure without the cytie of the eastsyde, two thousande cubytes. And of the southsyde, two thousande cubytes. And of the westsyde, two thousande cubytes. And of the northsyde, two thousaude cubites also: and the cytie shalbe in the myddes. And these shalbe the suburbes of theyr cyties.
Num.35.6	And from amonge the cyties whyche ye shall geue vnto the Leuytes, there shall be syxe cyties for refuge, which ye shall appointe to that intent, that he which kylleth, maye flye thyther. And to them ye shal adde .xlii. cyties mo:
Num.35.7	so that all the cyties whyche ye shall geue the Leuites, maye be .xlviii. with theyr suburbes.
Num.35.8	And these cities which ye shall geue, shall be out of the possession of the chyldren of Israel. They that haue many, shall geue many. But of them that haue fewe, ye shall take fewe. Euery one shall geue of hys cities vnto the Leuites, accordynge to the enheritaunce which he enheriteth.
Num.35.9	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, sayenge:
Num.35.10	speake vnto the chyldren of Israel and saye vnto them: whan ye be come ouer Iordane into the lande of Canaan,
Num.35.11	ye shall appoynte you cyties to be cyties of refuge for you: that he whych sleeth a soule vnwares, maye flye thyther.
Num.35.12	And the cytie shalbe to flye from the auenger of bloude, that he whyche kylleth dye not, vntyll he stande before the congregacion in iudgement.
Num.35.13	And of these syxe fre cyties whyche ye shall geue
Num.35.14	ye shall gyue thre on thys syde Iordan, and thre in the lande of Canaan.
Num.35.15	And these syxe fre cyties shalbe a refuge both for the chyldren of Israel, and for the straunger, and for hym that dwelleth amonge you: that all they which kill any persone vnwares, maye flye thyther.
Num.35.16	And yf any man smyte another with an instrument of yron that he dye, then is he a murtherer, and shall dye for it.
Num.35.17	If he smyte hym wyth a throwynge stone that a man maye dye with, and yf he dye, he that smote hym is a murtherer, let the same murtherer be slayne therfore.
Num.35.18	Or yf he smyte him with a handweapon of wodde that a man maye dye with, then yf he dye, he is a murtherer: let the murtherer be slayne therfore.
Num.35.19	The iustice of bloude shall slaye the murtherer: whan he meteth hym, he maye slaye hym.
Num.35.20	But yf the thrust at hym of hate, or hourle at him with layinge of wayte, that he dye, or smyte hym with hys hande of enuye that he dye,
Num.35.21	he that smote him shall dye, for he is a murtherer. The iustice of bloude shall slaye the murthurer, as soone as he findeth him.
Num.35.22	But and yf he pusshed hym by chaunce and not of hate, or cast at him with any maner of thynge and not of layinge of wayte:
Num.35.23	or cast any maner of stone at him (that a man maye dye with) and sawe hym not. And he cast it vpon hym and he dye, and was not hys enemye, nether sought him any harme.
Num.35.24	Then the congregacyon shall iudge betwene the slayer and the executer of bloude in soche cases.
Num.35.25	And the congregacyon shall delyuer the slayer out of the hande of the auenger of bloude, and the congregacyon shall restore hym agayne vnto the cytie of hys refuge, whether he was fledd. And he shall byde there vnto the deathe of the hye preaste, which was anoynted with holy oyle.
Num.35.26	But Ꟶ yf the slayer come without the borders of his preuileged cytie whether he was fledd,
Num.35.27	yf the auenger of bloud fynde him withoute the borders of hys fre towne, and slaye the murtherer, he shal be gyltlesse,
Num.35.28	because he shulde haue bydden in hys fre towne vntyll the deeth of the hye preaste, and after the deeth of the hye preaste to retourne agayne vnto the lande of his possession.
Num.35.29	These commaundementes shalbe a lawe vnto you, for youre generacions in all youre dwellynges.
Num.35.30	Whosoeuer kylleth a soule, the same the manslayer must be slayne him selfe thorowe witnesses. Nether shall one witnesse answere to put a man to death.
Num.35.31	Moreouer, ye shall take none amendes for the lyfe of the murtherer which is worthy to dye: But he shall be put to death.
Num.35.32	Also ye shall take no money of hym that is fled to a fre cytie, that he shulde come agayne, and dwell in the lande, before the death of the hye preaste.
Num.35.33	And se that ye polute not the lande which ye shall dwell in: for bloud defyleth the lande. And the land can none other wyse be clensed of the bloude that is shed therin, but by the bloude of hym that shed bloude.
Num.35.34	Defyle not therfore the lande which ye shall inhabyte, for I am in the myddes therof: euen I the Lord dwell among the chyldren of Israel.
Num.36.1	And the auncient fathers of the children of Gilead the sonne of Machir the sonne of Manasse of the kynred of the chyldren of Ioseph, came forth Ꟶ spake before Moses and the prynces, and auncyent fathers of the chyldren of Israel,
Num.36.2	and sayde: The Lorde commaunded my Lord, to geue the lande to enheret by lotte to the chyldren of Israel. And my Lorde commaunded in gods behalfe, to geue the enheritaunce of zelaphead oure brother vnto hys daughters.
Num.36.3	Whom yf any of the sonnes of the other trybes of Israel take to wyues, then shall theyr enheritaunce be taken from the enheritaunce of oure fathers, and shall be put vnto the enheritaunce of the trybe which they are receaued into: and shalbe taken from the lotte of oure enheritaunce.
Num.36.4	And when the yere of iubelye of the chyldren of Israel commeth then shall theyr enheritaunce be put vnto the enheritaunce of the trybe wherin to they are receaued: and so shall theyr enheritaunce be taken awaye from the enheritaunce of the trybe of oure fathers.
Num.36.5	And Moses commaunded the children of Israel accordynge to the worde of the Lorde sayinge: the chyldren of the trybe of Ioseph haue sayd well.
Num.36.6	This therfore doeth the Lorde commaunde the daughters of zelaphead sayinge let them be wyues to whom they them selfe thynck best, onely to the kynred and trybe of theyr father shall they marye,
Num.36.7	so shal not the enheritaunce of the chyldren of Israel remoue from trybe to trybe, whan the chyldren of Israel abyde euery man in the enheritaunce of the trybe of his fathers.
Num.36.8	And euery daughter that possesseth any enheritaunce in any trybe of the children of Israel, shalbe wyfe vnto one which is of the kynred of the trybe of her father, that the chyldren of Israel maye enioye euery man the enheritaunce of hys father:
Num.36.9	Neyther ought the enheritaunce to go from one trybe to another: but euery one of the trybes of the chyldren of Israel, must abyde in hys awne enheritaunce.
Num.36.10	And as the Lorde commaunded Moses euen so dyd the daughters of zelaphead.
Num.36.11	And Mahela, Thirza, Hagla, Milcha and Noa were maryed vnto theyr fathers brothers sonnes,
Num.36.12	which were of the kynred of the chyldren of Manasses the sonne of Ioseph: and so theyr enheritaunce remayned in the trybe of the kynred of theyr father.
Num.36.13	These are the commaundementes Ꟶ lawes which the Lorde commaunded by the hande of Moses, vnto the chyldren of Israel in the feldes of Moab by Iordane ouer agaynst Iericho.
