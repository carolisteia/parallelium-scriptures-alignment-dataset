Deut.0.0	¶ The fyfth boke of Moses called in the Hebrue: elle Haddebarim, Ꟶ in the Latin. Deuteronomium.
Deut.1.1	These be the wordes which Moses spake vnto all Israel, on the other syde Iordan in the wildernesse, in the plaine ouer agaynst the redd see, betwene Pharan and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Disahab,
Deut.1.2	eleuen dayes iourney from Horeb vnto Cades barne, by mount Seir.
Deut.1.3	And it fortuned the fyrst daye of the eleuenth moneth in the fortieth yere, that Moses spake vnto the chyldren of Israel accordinge vnto all that the Lorde had geuen him in commaundement vnto them,
Deut.1.4	after that he had smytten Sehon the kynge of the Amorites which dwelt in Hesbon, and Og kyng of Basan which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrai.
Deut.1.5	On the other syde Iordan in the lande of Moab, begane Moses to declare thys lawe sayinge:
Deut.1.6	the Lorde oure God spake vnto vs in Horeb saying: Ye haue dwelt longe ynough in this mount.
Deut.1.7	departe therfore Ꟶ take youre iourney, and go vnto the hyll of the Amorites and vnto all places nye there vnto: both vnto the playne, and hylles and dales: to the south, to the sees syde, to the lande of Canaan, and vnto Libanon: euen vnto the greate ryuer Euphrates.
Deut.1.8	Beholde, I haue set the land before you: goo in and possesse the lande whych the Lorde sware vnto youre fathers Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, to geue vnto them and theyr seede after them.
Deut.1.9	And I spake vnto you the same ceason sayinge: I am not able to beare you my selfe alone.
Deut.1.10	For the Lorde youre God had multiplyed you: and beholde, ye are thys daye as the starres of heauen in nombr
Deut.1.11	(the Lorde God of youre fathers make you a thousande tymes so many moo as ye are, and blesse you as he hath promysed you)
Deut.1.12	howe can I my selfe alone, beare the combraunce, charge and stryfe that is amonge you?
Deut.1.13	brynge (from amonge you) men of wysdome and of vnderstandynge, and experte, accordynge to youre trybes, and I wyll make them ruelars ouer you.
Deut.1.14	And ye answered me and sayde: that whyche thou hast spoken is good for vs to do.
Deut.1.15	And out of youre trybes I toke the captaynes, (men of wysdome and that were experte) and made them ruelars ouer you: captaynes ouer thousandes Ꟶ ouer hundredes ouer fyftye and ouer ten, and offycers amonge youre trybes.
Deut.1.16	And I charged youre Iudges that same tyme saying: heare the cause of your brethren and iudge ryghteously betwene euery man and hys brother, and the straunger that is with hym.
Deut.1.17	Se that ye knowe no faces in Iudgement: but heare the small as well as the greate, and be afrayed of no man, for the iudgement is Gods. And the cause that is to harde for you, brynge vnto me, and I will heare it.
Deut.1.18	And I commaunded you the same ceason, all the thynges whyche ye shulde do.
Deut.1.19	And when we departed from Horeb, we went thorowe all that greate and terrible wyldernesse, as ye haue sene alonge by the waye of the hyll of the Amorites, as the Lorde oure God commaunded vs, and came to Cades Barne.
Deut.1.20	And I sayde vnto you: Ye are come vnto the hyll of the Amorites, which the Lord oure God wyll geue vnto vs.
Deut.1.21	Beholde, the Lorde thy God hath set the lande before the: goo vp and conquere it, as the Lorde God of thy fathers hath sayde vnto the feare not, nether be discouraged.
Deut.1.22	But ye came vnto me euery one and sayde we wyll sende men before vs, to searche vs oute the lande, and to brynge vs worde agayne, what waye we must go vp by, Ꟶ vnto what cyties we shall come.
Deut.1.23	And the sayinge pleased me well, and I toke twelue men of you, of euery trybe one.
Deut.1.24	Whych departed, and went vp into the hye contrey, and came vnto the ryuer Escoll, and serched it out,
Deut.1.25	Ꟶ toke of the frute of the lande in theyr handes Ꟶ brought it vnto vs, and brought vs worde agayne, Ꟶ sayde: it is a good lande, whych the Lorde oure God doth geue vs.
Deut.1.26	Notwithstandynge ye wolde not consente to goo vp, but were disobedient vnto the mouth of the Lord youre God,
Deut.1.27	and murmured in youre tentes, Ꟶ sayde: because the Lorde hateth vs, therfore hath he brought vs out of the lande of Egypte, to delyuer vs into the hande of the Amorites, and to destroye vs.
Deut.1.28	Howe shal we goo vp? Oure brethren haue discoraged oure herte, sayinge: the people is greater Ꟶ taller then we, and haue cyties greate and walled euen vp to heauen, Ꟶ moreouer we haue sene the sonnes of the Enakims there.
Deut.1.29	And I sayde vnto you: dreade not, nor be afrayed of them.
Deut.1.30	The Lorde youre God which goeth before you, he shall fyghte for you, accordynge to all that he dyd vnto you in Egypte before youre eyes.
Deut.1.31	In the wyldernersse also thou hast sene howe that the Lorde thy God bare the, euen as a man doth beare hys sonne, in all the waye whyche ye haue gone by, vntyll ye came vnto thys place.
Deut.1.32	And yet in this thyng ye dyd not beleue the Lorde youre God.
Deut.1.33	He went in the waye before you, to serche you out a place to pytche youre tentes in, in fyre by nyght, that ye myghte se what waye to go, and in a cloude by daye.
Deut.1.34	And the Lorde hearde the voyce of youre wordes, and was wroth, Ꟶ sware, sayinge:
Deut.1.35	there shall not one of these men and of this frowarde generacyon se that good lande which I sware to geue vnto youre fathers,
Deut.1.36	saue Caleb the sonne of Iephune, he shall se it and to hym wyll I geue that lande that he hath trodden vpon, and to his chyldren, because he hath folowed the Lord
Deut.1.37	the Lorde was angrye wythe me lykewyse for youre sakes, saying: thou also shalt not go in thither.
Deut.1.38	But Iosua the sonne of Nun which standeth before the, he shall go in thither. Bolden hym therfore, for he shal cause Israel to inheret the lande.
Deut.1.39	Moreouer youre chyldren, which ye sayde shulde be a praye, and youre sonnes which in that daye had no knowlege betwene good and euell, they shall goo in thither, and vnto them will I geue it, and they shall enioye it.
Deut.1.40	But as for you, turne youre face, and take youre iourneye into the wildernesse: euen by the waye of the reade see.
Deut.1.41	Then ye answered Ꟶ sayde vnto me: We haue synned agaynst the Lorde: we wyll go vp and fyghte, accordynge to all that the Lord oure God commaunded vs. And when ye had gyrde on euery man his wepons of warre, beholde, ye were ready to goo vp into the hyll.
Deut.1.42	And the Lorde sayde vnto me: saye vnto them, that they go not vp, and that they fyghte not, for I am not among you: lest ye fall before youre enemyes
Deut.1.43	I tolde you therfore, and ye wolde not heare, but disobeyed the mouth of the Lorde, Ꟶ went presumptuously vp into the hyll.
Deut.1.44	And the Amorites whych dwelt in that hyll, came out agaynst you, and chased you (as bees vse to do) Ꟶ smote you in Seir, euen vnto Horma.
Deut.1.45	And ye came agayne, Ꟶ wepte before the Lorde: but the Lorde wolde not heare youre voyce, nor geue you audience.
Deut.1.46	And so ye abode in Cades a longe ceason, according vnto the tyme that ye remayned in other places.
Deut.2.1	Then we tourned oure face, Ꟶ toke oure iourney into the wyldernesse euen by the waye of the read see as the Lorde spake vnto me. And we compassed mount Seir a longe tyme.
Deut.2.2	And the Lord spake vnto me, sayinge:
Deut.2.3	Ye haue compassed thys mountayne longe ynough, tourne you northward.
Deut.2.4	And warne thou the people sayinge: Ye shall go thorowe the coast of youre brethren the chyldren of Esau whyche dwell in Seir, Ꟶ they shalbe afrayed of you: Take ye good hede vnto your selues therfore.
Deut.2.5	Ye shall not prouoke them, for I wyll not geue you of their lande, no not so moche as a fote bredth because I haue geuen mounte Seir vnto Esau to possess
Deut.2.6	ye shall bye meat of them for money to eate, and ye shall procure water of them for money to drynke.
Deut.2.7	For the Lord thy God hath blessed the in all the workes of thy hande. He knewe thy entrynge into this greate wyldernesse this .xl. yeres, and the Lorde thy God hath bene with the, so that thou hast lacked nothynge.
Deut.2.8	And when we were departed from oure brethren the chyldren of Esau whych dwelt in Seir, the playne waye from Elath Ꟶ from Ezion Gaber, we turned Ꟶ went by the waye of the wyldernesse of Moab.
Deut.2.9	And the Lorde sayde vnto me: Thou shalt not fyght agaynst the Moabites, nether prouoke them to battell, for I wyll not geue the of their lande to possesse:
Deut.2.10	because I haue geuen Ar vnto the children of Loth to possesse. The terrible people the Emims dwelt therin in tymes past, a people great, many Ꟶ tall, as the Enakims:
Deut.2.11	whych also were taken for giauntes as the Enakims: whom the Moabites call Emims.
Deut.2.12	The Horims dwelt in Seir before tyme, whose possessyon the chyldren of Esau occupyed, and destroyed them before them, Ꟶ dwelt in their stead: as Israel dyd vnto the lande of his possession, which the Lorde gaue them.
Deut.2.13	Nowe ryse vp (sayd I) Ꟶ get you ouer the ryuer zared: Ꟶ we went ouer the ryuer zared.
Deut.2.14	The space in whych we came from Cades barne vntyll we were come ouer the ryuer zared, was .xxxviii. yeres: vntyll all the generacyon of the men of warre were wasted out from amonge the host, as the Lorde sware vnto them.
Deut.2.15	For in dede the hande of the Lorde was agaynst them, to destroye them from amonge the host, tyll they were consumed.
Deut.2.16	And so it came to passe, that all the men of warre were consumed and deed from amonge the people.
Deut.2.17	And the Lorde spake vnto me, sayinge:
Deut.2.18	Thou shalt go thorow Ar the coast of Moab thys daye:
Deut.2.19	and whan thou commest nye vnto the chyldren of Ammon, thou shalt not laye sege vnto them, ner moue warre agaynst them. For I wyll not geue the of the lande of the chyldren of Ammon a possessyon,
Deut.2.20	but I haue geuen it vnto the chyldren of Loth to possesse. That also is taken for a land of giauntes, and giauntes dwelt therin in olde tyme, whom the Ammonites call zanzumims.
Deut.2.21	A people that was great, many, Ꟶ talle, as the Enakims. But the Lord destroyed them before them, Ꟶ they succeaded them in the inheritaunce Ꟶ dwelt in theyr steade:
Deut.2.22	as he dyd for the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir: whan he destroyed the Horyms before them they conquered theyr possessyon, and dwelt in theyr steade vnto this daye.
Deut.2.23	And the Auims which dwelt in Hazarim euen vnto Aza, the Caphthoryms which came out of Caphthor destroyed them, and dwelt in theyr steade.
Deut.2.24	Ryse ye vp therfore, and take youre iourney ouer the ryuer Arnon. Beholde, I haue geuen into thy hande Sehon the Amorite kyng of Hesbon, and his lande. Go to therfore and conquere, and prouoke hym to battell.
Deut.2.25	This daye wyll I begynne to sende the feare and dreade of the, vpon all nacions that are vnder all the heauen: so that they whych heare speake of the, shall tremble and quake before the.
Deut.2.26	And so I sent messengers out of the wyldernesse of kedemoth vnto Sehon kynge of Hesbon, with wordes of peace, sayinge:
Deut.2.27	I wyll go thorowe thy lande. I wyll go alonge by the hye waye: I wyll nether turne vnto the ryghte hande nor to the lefte.
Deut.2.28	Thou shalt sell me meate for money for to eate, and geue me drinke for money for to drinke. Onely graunt me, that I maye go thorowe on my fot
Deut.2.29	(as the chyldren of Esau which dwell in Seir, Ꟶ the Moabites whych dwell in Ar, dyd vnto me) vntyll I be come ouer Iordan, into the lande which the Lorde oure God geueth vs.
Deut.2.30	But Sehon the kynge of Hesbon wolde not let vs passe by him, for the Lord thy God hardened his sprete, Ꟶ made his herte tough, because he wolde delyuer him into thy hande, as it is come to passe thys daye.
Deut.2.31	And the Lorde sayde vnto me: beholde, I haue begonne to set Sehon and his lande before the: go to and conquere, and possesse his lande.
Deut.2.32	Then both Sehon Ꟶ all hys people came out agaynst vs to fyght at Iaza.
Deut.2.33	And the Lorde set him before vs, Ꟶ we smote him and hys sonnes and all hys people.
Deut.2.34	And we toke all his cyties the same ceason, and slue the men, wemen and chyldren of all the cyties, and let nothynge remayne,
Deut.2.35	saue the catell onely we caught vnto oure selues, and the spoyle of the cyties which we toke,
Deut.2.36	from Aroer which is by the brinke of the ryuer of Arnon, Ꟶ from the cytie that is in the ryuer, vnto Gilead: there was not one cytie to stronge for vs. The Lorde oure God delyuered all vnto vs:
Deut.2.37	onely vnto the lande of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor vnto euery place of the ryuer Iabock, nor vnto the cyties in the mountaynes, nor vnto whatsoeuer the Lorde oure God forbade vs.
Deut.3.1	Then we turned Ꟶ went vp the waye to Basan. And Og the kynge of Basan came out agaynst vs: he and all hys people to battel at Edrai.
Deut.3.2	And the Lord sayde vnto me: feare him not, for I wyll delyuer hym, Ꟶ all his people and hys lande into thy hande, and thou shalt do vnto him, as thou dyddest vnto Sehon kinge of the Amorites, which dwelt at Hesbon.
Deut.3.3	And so the Lorde oure God delyuered into oure handes, Og also the kynge of Basan and all hys folke. And we smote him, vntyll none was lefte hym alyue.
Deut.3.4	And we toke all his cyties the same ceason (nether was there a cytie which we toke not from them) euen thre score cyties thorow out all the region of Argob, the kyngdome of Og in Basan.
Deut.3.5	All these cyties also were made stronge with hye walles, gates and barres, besyde vnwalled townes a greate meanye.
Deut.3.6	And we vtterly destroyed them, as we dyd vnto Sehon kynge of Hesbon, bringyng to nought all the cyties, with men, wemen and chyldren.
Deut.3.7	But all the catell and the spoyle of the cyties, we caughte for oure selues.
Deut.3.8	And thus we toke the same ceason, out of the hande of two kynges of the Amorites, the lande that was on the other syde Iordan, from the ryuer of Arnon vnto mount Hermon
Deut.3.9	(whych Hermon the Sidons call Syrion, and the Amorites call it Senyr)
Deut.3.10	all the cyties that laye in the playne, and all Gilead and all Basan vnto Salecha and Edrai, cityes of the kyngdome of Og in Basan.
Deut.3.11	For onely Og kynge of Basan remayned of the remnaunt of the gyauntes, whose bed was a bed of yron. And is it not yet at Rabah amonge the chyldren of Ammon? .ix. cubytes doth the length therof conteyne, and foure cubytes the breadth of it, after the cubite of a man.
Deut.3.12	And so we conquered this lande the same tyme, from Aroer whych is by the ryuer of Arnon, vnto halfe mount Gilead, Ꟶ the cities therof gaue I vnto the Rubenites and Gaddites.
Deut.3.13	And the rest of Gilead and all Basan of the kyngdome of Og, gaue I vnto the halfe trybe of Manasse: euen all the rygyon of Argob with all Basan: which is called the lande of gyauntes.
Deut.3.14	Iair the sonne of Manasse toke all the region of Argob vnto the coastes of Gesuri and Maachati, and called them after hys owne name: Basan Hauoth Iair vnto thys daye.
Deut.3.15	And I gaue Gilead vnto Machir.
Deut.3.16	And vnto the Rubenites and Gaddites I gaue halfe Gilead vnto the ryuer of Arnon, halfe the valey Ꟶ beyonde, euen vnto the ryuer Iabock, which is the border of the chyldren of Ammon:
Deut.3.17	the playne also and Iordan and the coast therof, from Ceneroth euen vnto the see whych is in the playne, euen the salt see vnder the springes of the hyll, eastwarde.
Deut.3.18	And I commaunded you the same tyme sayinge: the Lorde youre God hath geuen you thys lande to enioye it: ye shall go harnessed before youre brethren the chyldren of Israel, all that are mete for the warre.
Deut.3.19	Youre wyues onely, youre chyldren, and youre catell (for I wote that ye haue moche catell) shall abyde in youre cyties which I haue geuen you,
Deut.3.20	vntill the Lorde haue geuen rest vnto youre brethren as well as vnto you, and vntyll they also haue conquered the lande, whyche the Lord youre God hath geuen them beyonde Iordan: and then shall ye returne agayne, euery man vnto hys possession which I haue geuen you.
Deut.3.21	And I warned Iosua the same tyme sayinge: thyne eyes haue sene all that the Lorde youre God hath done vnto these two kinges euen so shall he do vnto all kyngdomes whyther thou goest.
Deut.3.22	Ye shall not feare them, for the Lord youre God, he shall fyghte for you.
Deut.3.23	And I besoughte the Lorde the same tyme sayinge:
Deut.3.24	O Lorde God, thou hast begonne to shewe thy seruaunte thy greatnesse and thy myghtye hande, for els where is there a God in heauen or in erth, that can do after thy workes and after thy power?
Deut.3.25	let me go ouer and se the good lande that is beyonde Iordan, that goodly mountayne, and Libanon.
Deut.3.26	But the Lorde was angrye wyth me for youre sakes, and wolde not heare me. And the Lorde sayed vnto me: be content, speake no moare vnto me of this matter.
Deut.3.27	Get the vp into the toppe of the hyll, and lyfte vp thyne eyes westwarde, north warde, southwarde, and eastewarde, and beholde it wyth thyne eyes, for thou shalt not go ouer thys Iordan.
Deut.3.28	But charge Iosua: and courage him, Ꟶ bolden him. For he shal go before this people, and he shall deuyde vnto them the lande whyche thou shalt se.
Deut.3.29	And so we abode in the valye ouer agaynst the house of Peor.
Deut.4.1	And now herken O Israel vnto the ordinaunces and lawes which I teache you, for to do them, that so ye maye lyue Ꟶ go in and conquere the lande, which the Lord God of youre fathers geueth you.
Deut.4.2	Ye shall put nothinge vnto the worde which I commaunde you, nether do ought therfrom, that ye maye kepe the commaundementes of the Lord youre God which I commaunde you.
Deut.4.3	Youre eyes haue sene what the Lorde dyd vnto Baal Peor for all the men that folowed Baal Peor, the Lorde youre God hath destroyed from amonge you.
Deut.4.4	But ye that cleue vnto the Lorde youre God, are alyue euery one of you this daye.
Deut.4.5	Behold I haue taught you ordinaunces and lawes, soch as the Lorde my God commaunded me, that ye shulde do euen so in the lande, whether ye go to possesse it.
Deut.4.6	Kepe them therfore and do them, for that is youre wysdome Ꟶ vnderstandynge in the syghte of the nacyons: that they maye heare all these ordinaunces, and saye: Surely it is a wyse and vnderstandynge people: it is a greate nacyon.
Deut.4.7	For what other nacyon is so greate, that Goddes come so nye vnto: as the Lorde oure God is nye vnto vs, in all thynges as oft as we call vnto him?
Deut.4.8	Ye, Ꟶ what nacyon is so greate, that hath ordinaunces Ꟶ lawes so righteous, as all this lawe whyche I sett before you this daye?
Deut.4.9	Take hede to thy selfe therfore, and kepe thy soule diligently, that thou forget not the thynges which thyne eyes haue sene, Ꟶ that they departe not out of thyne harte, all the dayes of thy lyfe: but teache them thy sonnes Ꟶ thy sonnes sonnes:
Deut.4.10	Specially the daye that thou stodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord sayed vnto me: gether me the people together, and I wyll make them heare my wordes, that they maye lerne to feare me all the dayes that they shall lyue vpon the erth and that they maye teache their chyldren:
Deut.4.11	ye came and stode also vnder the hyll, and the hyll burnt with fyre: euen vnto the myddes of heauen, Ꟶ there was darcknesse, clowdes Ꟶ myst.
Deut.4.12	And the Lorde spake vnto you out of the myddes of the fyre, Ꟶ ye herde the voyce of the wordes but sawe no ymage, saue herde a voyce onely.
Deut.4.13	And he declared vnto you his couenaunt which he commaunded you to do, euen .x. verses, which he wrote vpon two tables of stone.
Deut.4.14	And the Lorde commaunded me that same ceason, that I shulde teach you ordinaunces and lawes, which ye ought to do in the lande whether ye go to possesse it.
Deut.4.15	Take therfore good hede vnto youre selues as pertaynynge vnto youre soules, for ye sawe no maner of ymage in the daye that the Lorde spake vnto you in Horeb out of the myddes of the fyre: lest ye marre youre selues
Deut.4.16	and make you a grauen ymage and picture of eny maner of fygure: the lykenesse of man or woman,
Deut.4.17	the lycknesse of any maner of beast that is on the erth, or the lykenesse of any maner feathered foule that flyeth in the ayre,
Deut.4.18	or the lyknesse of any maner worme that crepeth on the erth, or the liknesse of any maner fyshe that is in the waters beneth the erth.
Deut.4.19	Ye and leste thou lyfte vp thyne eyes vnto heuen and when thou seyst the sonne, the moone and the starres with all the hoost of heauen, shuldest be desceaued, and shuldest worshippe and serue the thynges, which the Lorde thy God hath made to serue all nacyons vnder the whole heauen.
Deut.4.20	But the Lorde hath taken you, Ꟶ brought you out of the yron fornace: euen out of Egypte, to be vnto him a people and enheritaunce, as ye be this daye.
Deut.4.21	Furthermoare, the Lorde was angrye with me for youre sakes, and sware, that I shulde not go ouer Iordan, and that I shulde not go in vnto that good land, which the Lorde thy God geueth the to enheritaunce.
Deut.4.22	But I must dye in thys land, and shall not go ouer Iordan. But ye shall go ouer, and conquere that good lande.
Deut.4.23	Take hede vnto youre selues, that ye forgett not the appoyntement of the Lorde your God whyche he made with you, and that ye make you no grauen ymage, or any pycture, that the Lorde thy God hath forbydden the.
Deut.4.24	For the Lorde thy God is a consumynge fyre, and a gelouse God.
Deut.4.25	If thou dost beget chyldren childrens children, Ꟶ whan ye haue dwelt in the lande, ye do wikedly, Ꟶ make any maner of grauen ymage, and worke euell in the syghte of the Lord thy God, to prouoke him to anger,
Deut.4.26	I call heauen and erth to recorde agaynst you thys daye, that ye shall shortely perish from of the lande, whether ye go ouer Iordan to possesse it: ye shall not prolonge youre dayes therin, but shall vtterly be destroyed
Deut.4.27	And the Lord shall skater you amonge the nacyons, and ye shalbe lefte fewe in nombre amonge the people, whether the Lorde shall brynge you:
Deut.4.28	and there ye shall serue goddes, whyche are the worke of mans hande, wood and stone, which nether se, nor heare, nor eate, nor smell.
Deut.4.29	And there thou shalt seke the Lorde thy God: Ꟶ shalt fynde hym, yf thou seke hym wt all thyne herte, and with all thy soule.
Deut.4.30	Whan thou are in tribulacyon, and when all these thynges (that be here spoken of) are come vpon the euen in the later dayes, thou shalt be obedient vnto his voyce.
Deut.4.31	For the Lord thy God is a mercyfull God: he will not forsake the, nether destroye the nor forget the appoyntement of thy fathers, which he sware vnto them.
Deut.4.32	For aske of the dayes that are past, which were before the sence the daye that God created man vpon the erth, and (aske) from the one syde of heauen vnto the other, yf euer there came to passe soch a greate thing, or whether any soche lyke thynge hath bene herde.
Deut.4.33	Dyd euer a nacyon heare the voyce of God speakynge out of the myddes of a fyre, as thou hast herde, and yet lyued?
Deut.4.34	other whether God assayed to go and take hym a people from amonge nacyons thorowe temptacions, signes wondres, warre, a myghtie hande, a stretched out arme, and thorowe greate syghtes, accordynge vnto all that the Lord youre God dyd vnto you in Egypte before youre eyes?
Deut.4.35	Unto the it was shewed, that thou myghtest knowe, howe that the Lorde he is God, and that there is none other but he.
Deut.4.36	Out of heauen he made the heare his voyce, that he myght nourter the, and vpon erth he shewed the hys greate fyre, Ꟶ thou heardest his wordes out of the myddes of the fyre.
Deut.4.37	And because he loued thy fathers, he chose theyr seed after them, and broughte the out in his syght, Ꟶ with his myghtie power out of Egipte:
Deut.4.38	to thrust out nacyons great Ꟶ myghtyer then thou, before the, and to brynge the in, Ꟶ to geue the their lande to enheritaunce: as it is come to passe thys daye.
Deut.4.39	Understande therfore thys daye, Ꟶ turne it to thyne hert, that the Lorde, he is God in heauen aboue, and vpon the erth beneth: neyther is there any other.
Deut.4.40	Thou shalt kepe therfore his ordinaunces, and hys commaundementes which I commaunde the thys daye, that it maye go well with the and with thy chyldren after the, Ꟶ that thou mayst prolonge thy dayes vpon the erth, which the Lord thy God geueth the thy lyfe longe.
Deut.4.41	Then Moses seuered thre cyties on the other syde Iordan towarde the sonne rysynge,
Deut.4.42	that he shulde flye thyther, which had kylled hys neyghboure vnwares, Ꟶ hated hym not in tyme past, Ꟶ therfore shulde flye vnto one of the same cyties, and lyue:

Deut.5.2	The Lorde oure God made an apoyntment with vs in Horeb.
Deut.5.3	The Lorde made not this bonde with oure fathers, but with vs: euen with vs, which are all here alyue thys daye.
Deut.5.4	The Lorde talked with you face to face in the mount, oute of the myddes of the fyrere.
Deut.5.5	And I stode betwene the Lorde and you the same tyme, and shewed you the worde of the Lorde. For ye were afrayed at the syght of the fyre, and went not vp into the mount, Ꟶ he sayed

Deut.5.22	These wordes the Lorde spake vnto all your multitude in the mount out of the myddes of the fyre, cloude and darcknesse, with a greate voyce, added nomore therto, and wrote them in two tables of stone, and delyuered them vnto me.
Deut.5.23	And it fortuned, that whan ye herde the voyce out of the myddes of the darcknesse, Ꟶ sawe that the hill dyd burne with fyre, ye came vnto me with the captaynes of youre tribes and youre elders:
Deut.5.24	and ye sayde: beholde, the Lord oure God hath shewed vs his glorye and his greatnesse, Ꟶ we haue herde his voyce out of the myddes of the fyre: we haue sene thys daye, that God doth talke wyth a man, and he yet lyueth.
Deut.5.25	Nowe therfore, why shulde we dye, that thys greate fyre shulde consume vs? If we heare the voyce of the Lord oure God any moare, we shal dye.
Deut.5.26	For what fleshe hath it bene, that euer hearde the voyce of the lyuynge God speakinge out of the myddes of the fyre (as we haue done) and yet dyd lyue?

Deut.5.32	Take hede therfore, that ye do in dede as the Lorde youre God hath commaunded you, Ꟶ turne not asyde: ether to the ryghte hande or to the lefte:
Deut.5.33	but walke in all the wayes which the Lorde youre God hath commaunded you, that ye maye lyue, and that it maye go well with you, and that ye maye prolonge youre dayes, in the lande which ye shall possesse.
Deut.6.1	These are the commaundementes, ordinaunces and lawes whych the Lord youre God commaunded me to teach you that ye might do them in the lande whether ye go to possesse it:
Deut.6.2	namely, that thou myghtest feare the Lorde thy God, and kepe all hys ordinaunces and hys commaundementes whych I commaunde the: thou and thy sonne, and thy sonnes sonne all dayes of thy lyfe, that thy dayes maye be prolonged.

Deut.6.16	Ye shall not tempte the Lorde your God as ye dyd in the tentacyon.
Deut.6.17	But kepe the commaundementes of the Lorde youre God, and hys witnesses and his ordinaunces which he hath commaunded the,
Deut.6.18	and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the syghte of the Lorde: that thou mayst prospere, and that thou mayst go in, and conquere that good lande whyche the Lorde sware vnto thy fathers,
Deut.6.19	to cast oute all thyne enemyes before the as the Lorde hath sayed.
Deut.6.20	And when thy sonne asketh the in tyme to come, sayinge: What meaneth these witnesses, ordinaunces Ꟶ lawes, which the Lorde oure God hath commaunded you?
Deut.6.21	Then thou shalt saye vnto thy sonne: We were Pharaos bondmen in Egypte, and the Lorde brought vs out of Egipte with a myghtie hande.
Deut.6.22	And the Lorde shewed signes Ꟶ wondres greate Ꟶ euell vpon Egypte, vpon Pharao Ꟶ vpon all hys housholde, before oure eyes,
Deut.6.23	but brought vs oute from thence: to brynge vs in, and to geue vs the lande which he sware vnto oure fathers.
Deut.6.24	And he hath commaunded vs, to do all these ordinaunces, and to feare the Lorde oure God, for oure welth all the dayes of our lyfe, as it is come to passe thys daye.
Deut.6.25	Moreouer thys shalbe oure ryghteousnes before the Lorde oure God, yf we take hede Ꟶ kepe all these commaundmentes, as he hath commaunded vs.
Deut.7.1	When the Lord thy God hath brought the into the lande whyther thou goest to possesse it, Ꟶ hath cast out many nacions before the: namely, the Hethites, the Gergesites, the Amorites, the Cananites, the Pheresites, the Heuites Ꟶ the Iebusites, seuen nacyons greater, and myghtier than tho
Deut.7.2	and when the Lorde thy God hath sett them before the, thou shalt smyte them, Ꟶ vtterly destroye them, and make no couenaunt with them, nor haue compassyon on them. Thou shalt make no mariages with them,
Deut.7.3	nether geue thy daughter vnto hys sonne, nor take hys daughter vnto thy sonne.
Deut.7.4	For they wyll disceaue thy sonne, that he shuld not feare me and they shall serue straunge goddes, and then wyll the wrath of the Lorde waxe whote agaynst you, and destroye you shortely.
Deut.7.5	But thus ye shall deale with them: Ye shall ouerthrowe theyr alters, Ꟶ breake doune theyr pylers, cut doune theyr groues, and burne theyr grauen ymages with fyre.
Deut.7.6	For thou art an holy nacyon vnto the Lorde thy God the Lorde thy God hath chosen the, to be a seuerall people vnto hym selfe, aboue all nacyons that are vpon the erth.
Deut.7.7	It was not because of the multitude of you aboue all nacyons, that the Lorde had lust vnto you and chose you, seynge ye were fewest of all nacyons.
Deut.7.8	But because the Lorde loued you, and because he wolde kepe the othe whyche he had sworne vnto your fathers, therfore hath the Lorde brought you oute of Egypte thorowe a myghtie hande, Ꟶ delyuered you out of the house of bondage: euen from the hande of Pharao kynge of Egypte.
Deut.7.9	Understande therfore, that the Lorde thy God he his God, Ꟶ that a true God whych kepeth poyntment and mercy vnto them that loue hym Ꟶ kepe his commaundementes, euen thorowe out a thousande generacyons:
Deut.7.10	and rewardeth them that hate him before hys face, so that he bringeth them to naught, and doth not deferre the tyme, but rewardeth him that hateth hym, before his face.
Deut.7.11	Kepe thou therfore the commaundementes, and ordinaunces and lawes, which I commaunde the this daye that thou do them.
Deut.7.12	If ye herken vnto these lawes, and obserue Ꟶ do them, the Lord thy God also shall kepe vnto the the poyntement, and the mercy which he sware vnto thy fathers.
Deut.7.13	He wyll loue the, Ꟶ blesse the, Ꟶ multiplye the: he wyll also blesse the frute of thy wombe, and the frute of thy londe, thy corne, thy wyne and thyne oyle, Ꟶ the frute of thine oxen, Ꟶ the flockes of thy shepe in the lande, which he sware vnto thy fathers to geue the.
Deut.7.14	Thou shalt be blessed aboue all nacyons: there shalbe nether man nor woman vnfrutefull amonge you, nor any thing vnfrutefull amonge your catell.
Deut.7.15	Moreouer the Lorde will take awaye from the all maner infirmityes, and will put none of the euell diseases of Egypte (whiche thou knowest) vpon the, but wyll sende them vpon all them that hate the.
Deut.7.16	Thou shalt consume all the nacions which the Lord thy God shall deliuer the: thyne eye shall haue no pytie vpon them, nether shalt thou serue theyr goddes, for that shalbe thy decaye.
Deut.7.17	If thou saye in thyne hert: these nacyons are moo than I, howe can I cast them out?
Deut.7.18	Thou shalt not feare them, but remembre, what the Lorde thy God dyd vnto Pharao and vnto all Egypte:
Deut.7.19	the greate temptacyons whych thyne eyes sawe, and the sygnes, and wondres, and the myghtye hande and stretched out arme, where thorowe the Lorde thy God brought the out: euen so shall the Lorde thy God do vnto all the nacyons, of whom thou art afrayed.
Deut.7.20	Moreouer the Lord thy God will sende hornettes amonge them vntyll they that are lefte, and hyde them selues from the, be destroyed.
Deut.7.21	Thou shalt not feare them, for the Lord thy God is among you, a myghtie God and a terrible.
Deut.7.22	For the Lorde thy God wyll put out these nacyons before the by a lytle Ꟶ a lytle thou mayst not consume them at once, lest the beastes of the felde encrease vpon the.
Deut.7.23	But the Lorde thy God shall geue them ouer before the, and shall destroye them with a myghtie tempest, vntill he haue brought them to naught.
Deut.7.24	And he shall delyuer theyr kynges in to thyne hande, and thou shalt destroye their name from vnder heauen. There shall no man be able to stande before the, vntyll thou haue destroyed them.
Deut.7.25	The grauen ymages of theyr goddes shalt thou burne wyth fyre, Ꟶ couet not the golde and syluer that is on them, nor take it vnto the, lest thou be snared ther in. For it is an abhominacyon before the Lorde thy God.
Deut.7.26	Brynge not therfore abhominacyon in to thyne house, lest thou be a damned thynge, as it is: but vtterlye defye it and abhorre it, for it is a damned thynge.
Deut.8.1	All the commaundmentes whych I commaunde the thys daye, shall ye kepe for to do them, that ye maye lyue and multiplie and go in, and possesse the lande whyche the Lorde sware vnto your fathers.
Deut.8.2	And thou shalt thynke on all the waye, which the Lorde thy God ledd the thys .xl. yeare in the wildernesse, for to humble the, Ꟶ to proue the, Ꟶ to wete what was in thyne herte, whether thou woldest kepe hys commaundmentes or no,
Deut.8.3	He humbled the, and suffred the to hongre, and fedd the with Manna, whych nether thou nor thy fathers knewe of, to make the knowe, that a man doth not lyue by bread only: but by euery that procedeth out of the mouth of the Lorde, doth a man lyue.
Deut.8.4	Thy rayment waxed not olde vpon the, nether dyd thy fote swell these .xl. yeares.
Deut.8.5	Thys also shalt thou consyder in thyne herte, that as a man nourtereth hys sonne, euen so the Lorde thy God nourtereth the.
Deut.8.6	Therfore shalt thou kepe the commaundementes of the Lorde thy God, that thou walke in his wayes, and feare hym.
Deut.8.7	For the Lord thy God bryngeth the into a good lande, a lande in the whych are ryuers of water, and fountayns and sprynges that springe out of valeyes and hylles:
Deut.8.8	a lande wherin is wheat Ꟶ barly, vyneyardes, fygtrees and pomgranates: a lande wherin is oyle olyue and honie:
Deut.8.9	a lande, wherin thou shalt eate bread wythout skarcenesse, neither shalt thou lacke anye thynge: a lande whose stones are yron, Ꟶ out of whose hylles thou shalt dygge brasse.
Deut.8.10	When thou hast eaten therfore and fylled thy selfe, thou shalt blesse the Lord thy God in that good lande, whych he hath geuen the.
Deut.8.11	Beware, that thou forgett not the Lorde thy God, that thou woldest not kepe hys commaundmentes, hys lawes Ꟶ his ordinaunces whych I commaunde the thys daye y
Deut.8.12	Ꟶ when thou hast eaten, and fylled thy selfe, Ꟶ hast bylt goodly houses Ꟶ dwelt therin,
Deut.8.13	and when thy beastes, and thy shepe are waxed manye, and thy syluer Ꟶ golde is multiplied, and all that thou hast is encreased,
Deut.8.14	then beware, lest thyne herte ryse Ꟶ thou forgett the Lorde thy God, whych brought the out of the lande of Egypte, and from the house of bondage,
Deut.8.15	Ꟶ whych was thy gyde in the greate and terrible wyldernesse (wherin were) fyrye serpentes, scorpions, and drouth without any water. But he brought out water for the, euen out of the rocke of flynt:
Deut.8.16	he fedd the in the wildernesse wyth Manna, whych thy fathers knewe not, euen for to humble the, and to proue the, and that he myght so do the good at thy later ende.
Deut.8.17	Lest thou shuldest saye in thyne herte my power Ꟶ the might of myne awne hande hath prepared me thys abundaunce:
Deut.8.18	But remembre the Lorde thy God, howe that it is he which geueth the power to get substaunce, for to make good the promesse whych he sware vnto thy fathers, as thys daye doth wytnesse.
Deut.8.19	And yf thou forget the Lorde thy God, and walke after straunge goddes, and serue them, Ꟶ worshype them, I testifye vnto you this daye, that he shall surely perysh.
Deut.8.20	As the nacions whych the Lorde destroyeth before you, euen so ye shall peryshe, because ye wolde not be obedient vnto the voyce of the Lorde youre God.
Deut.9.1	Heare O Israel, thou passest ouer Iordan thys daye, to go in, and conquere nacyons greate Ꟶ myghtier then thy selfe: cyties greate and walled vp to heauen,
Deut.9.2	a people greate and tall, euen the chyldren of the Enakims, whych thou knowest of, and of whom thou hast herde saye: who wyll stande before the chyldren of Enack?
Deut.9.3	Understande therfore thys daye, that the Lorde thy God is euen he whych goeth ouer before the as a a consumynge fyre, he shall destroye them and he shall brynge them downe before thy face. He shall cast them out, Ꟶ brynge them to nought quickly, as the Lord hath sayed vnto the.
Deut.9.4	Speake not thou in thyne hert (after that the Lord thy God hath cast them out before the) sayinge: for my ryghteousnes the Lorde hath brought me in, to possesse thys lande. Nay, but for the wyckednesse of these nacyons the Lorde hath cast them out before the.
Deut.9.5	It is not for thy righteousnes sake or for thy ryght hert, that thou goest to possesse theyr lande. But for the wyckednesse of these nacions, the Lorde thy God doth cast them out before the, euen to performe the worde, which the Lorde thy God sware vnto thy fathers, Abraham, Isahac and Iacob.
Deut.9.6	Understande therfore that it is not for thy ryghteousnes sake, that the Lorde thy God doth geue the thys good lande to possesse it seynge thou art a stiffenecked people.
Deut.9.7	Remembre Ꟶ forget not, howe thou prouokedest the Lorde thy God in the wyldernesse, sence the daye that thou dyddest departe out of the lande of Egypte vntyll ye came vnto thys place, ye haue rebelled agaynst the Lord.
Deut.9.8	Also in Horeb ye angred the Lorde, so that the Lord was wroth wyth you, euen to haue destroyed you,
Deut.9.9	whan I was gone vp into the mount, to receaue the tables of stone, the tables of appoyntment, whych the Lorde made with you. And Iabode in the hyll .xl. dayes Ꟶ .xl. nyghtes, whan I nether dyd eate bread nor dranke water.
Deut.9.10	And the Lord delyuered me two tables of stone, wryten with the fynger of God, Ꟶ in them was accordynge to all the wordes which the Lorde sayed vnto you in the mount out of the myddes of the fyre in the daye, of the gatherynge together.
Deut.9.11	And when the .xl. dayes Ꟶ .xl. nyghtes were ended, the Lorde gaue me the two tables of stone, the tables of the couenaunt,
Deut.9.12	and the Lorde sayde vnto me. Up, Ꟶ get the doune quickely from hence, for thy people which thou hast broughte out of Egypte, haue marred all. They are turned attonce out of the waye, whiche I commaunded them, and haue made them a molten ymage.
Deut.9.13	Furthermore, the Lord spake vnto me sayinge: I haue sene thys people, and beholde, it is a styffenecked people,
Deut.9.14	let me alone, that I maye destroye them, and put out the name of them from vnder heauen, and I wyll make of the a myghtie nacyon, Ꟶ greater than they be.
Deut.9.15	And I turned me, and came doune from the hyll (euen from the hyll that burnt wyth fyre) and the two tables of the appoyntment were in my handes.
Deut.9.16	And I loked, Ꟶ beholde, ye had synned agaynst the Lorde your God, Ꟶ had made you a molten calfe, and had turned attonce out of the waye whyche the Lord had commaunded you.
Deut.9.17	And I toke the two tables and cast them out of my two handes, and brake them before youre eyes.
Deut.9.18	And I fell downe flat before the Lorde: euen as at the fyrst tyme, and .xl. dayes Ꟶ .xl. nyghtes I dyd nether eate bread nor drincke water, because of all youre synnes, whych ye synned, in doynge wyckedly in the syght of the Lord in that ye prouoked hym vnto wrath.
Deut.9.19	For I was afrayed that for the wrath Ꟶ fearsnesse wher wyth the Lorde was moued agaynst you, he wolde haue destroyed you. But the Lorde herde me at that tyme also.
Deut.9.20	The Lorde was very angrye wyth Aaron also, euen to haue destroyed hym: Ꟶ I made intercessyon for Aaron also the same tyme:
Deut.9.21	And I toke youre synne the calfe whych ye had made and burnt hym with fyre, Ꟶ stamped hym Ꟶ grounde hym a good, euen vnto sinal dust. And I cast the dust therof into the brooke, that descended out of the mounte.
Deut.9.22	Also at the burnynge, at the tentacyon, and at the sepulchres of lust ye angred the Lord,
Deut.9.23	lykewyse when the Lorde sent you from Cades Barne, sayinge, go vp, and conquere the lande which I haue geuen you ye disobeyed the mouth of the Lorde youre God, and nether beleued him, nor herkened vnto his voyce.
Deut.9.24	Ye haue bene disobedient vnto the Lorde, sence the daye that I knewe you.
Deut.9.25	And I fell downe flat before the Lord .xl. dayes, and .xl. nyghtes whiche I laye there, for the Lorde sayde, that he wolde destroye you.
Deut.9.26	I made intercessyon therfore vnto the Lorde, and sayed: O Lorde God, destroye not thy people Ꟶ thyne enheritaunce, whych thou hast delyuered thorow thy greatnesse, and which thou hast brought out of Egypte thorowe a myghtie hand.
Deut.9.27	Remembre thy seruauntes Abraham, Isahac and Iacob, and loke not vnto the stoburnesse of this people, ner to theyr wickednesse Ꟶ synne:
Deut.9.28	lest the lande whence thou broughtest them, saye: The Lorde is not able to brynge them in to the lande, whych he promysed them: and because he hated them, therfore hath he caryed them out, to slaye them in the wyldernesse.
Deut.9.29	Beholde, they are thy people, and thyne enheritaunce, whyche thou broughtest out in thy myghtie power and in thy stretched out arme.
Deut.10.1	In the same ceason the Lord sayde vnto me hewe the two tables of stone lyke vnto the fyrst, and come vp vnto me in to the mount, Ꟶ make the an Arcke of wood,
Deut.10.2	Ꟶ I will wryte in the tables, the wordes that were in the fyrst tables which thou brakest, Ꟶ thou shalt put them in the arcke.
Deut.10.3	And I made an arcke of sethim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like vnto the fyrst, and went vp in to the mountayne, hauynge the two tables in myne hande.
Deut.10.4	And he wrote in the tables accordynge to the fyrst writynge (the ten verses whiche the Lorde spake vnto you in the mount out of the myddes of the fyre, in the daye of the gatherynge together) and the Lord gaue them vnto me.
Deut.10.5	And I departed, and came downe from the hyll, and put the tables in the arcke which I had made: and there they be, as the Lorde commaunded me.
Deut.10.6	And the chyldren of Israel toke theyr iourney from Beroth of the chyldren of Iakan to Mosera, where Aaron dyed, and was buryed, and Eleazer hys sonne became preast in hys stead:
Deut.10.7	From thence they departed vnto Gadgad: Ꟶ from Gadgad to Iathbath a land which hath riuers of water.
Deut.10.8	The same ceason the Lorde separated the trybe of Leui to beare the arcke of the appoyntment of the Lorde, Ꟶ to stande before the Lorde, Ꟶ to ministre vnto hym Ꟶ to blesse in his name vnto thys daye.
Deut.10.9	Wherfore the Leuites haue no parte nor enheritaunce wyth theyr brethren: But the Lorde is theyr enheritaunce, as the Lorde thy God hath promysed them.
Deut.10.10	And I taryed in the mount, euen as at the fyrst time .xl. dayes and .xl. nyghtes, and the Lorde herkened vnto me at that tyme also, Ꟶ the Lorde wolde not destroye the.
Deut.10.11	And the Lorde sayde vnto me: vp, and go forth in the iourneys before the people, that they maye go in, and conquere the lande which I sware vnto theyr fathers, to geue vnto them.
Deut.10.12	And nowe Israel, what doth the Lord thy God requier of the but to feare the Lorde thy God, and to walke in all hys wayes, to loue hym, and to serue the Lorde thy God with all thyne herte Ꟶ with all thy soule:
Deut.10.13	Namely, that thou kepe the commaundmentes of the Lorde, and hys ordinaunces whych I commaunde the thys daye, for thy welth.
Deut.10.14	Beholde, heauen and the heauen of heauens is the Lordes thy God, and the erth wyth all that therin is:
Deut.10.15	Notwythstondynge, the Lord had a lust vnto thy fathers to loue them, and chose theyr seed after them, euen you, aboue all nacyons, as thou seest thys daye.
Deut.10.16	Circumcyse therfore the foreskynne of youre harte, and be no more stiffnecked:
Deut.10.17	For the Lorde your God, is God of Goddes, and Lorde of Lordes, a greate God, a myghtye and a terrible whych regardeth no mans person nor taketh gyfte:
Deut.10.18	He doeth ryght vnto the fatherlesse Ꟶ wedowe, and loueth the straunger, to geue hym fode and rayment.
Deut.10.19	Loue ye therfore the straunger also: for ye were straungers youre selues in the lande of Egypte.
Deut.10.20	Thou shalt feare the Lorde thy God, Ꟶ hym (onely) shalt thou serue, to hym shalt thou cleue, and swere by hys nam
Deut.10.21	he is thy prayse and thy God, that hath done for the these greate and terrible thynges, whych thyne eyes haue sene.
Deut.10.22	Thy fathers went doune in to Egypte with .lxx. soules, and nowe the Lorde thy God hath made the Ꟶ multiplyed the, as the starres of heauen.
Deut.11.1	Therfore thou shalt loue the lord thy God Ꟶ kepe his obseruaunces, his ordinaunces, hys lawes, Ꟶ his commaundments alwaye.
Deut.11.2	Call to your mynde this daye that which youre chyldren haue nether knowen nor sene: euen the nourture of the Lorde youre God, hys greatnesse, hys myghtye hande, and hys stretched out arme:
Deut.11.3	his myracles and hys actes whych he dyd in the myddes of Egypte, euen vnto Pharao the kynge of Egypte and vnto all hys lande:
Deut.11.4	Ꟶ what he dyd vnto the host of Egypt, vnto theyr horses Ꟶ charettes howe he brought the water of the red see vpon them as they chased you behynde, Ꟶ howe the Lorde hath brought them to nought vnto thys daye:
Deut.11.5	Ꟶ what he dyd vnto you in the wildernesse, vntyll ye came vnto thys place:
Deut.11.6	Ꟶ what he dyd vnto Dathan and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab the sonne of Ruben, howe the erth opened hyr mouth, and swalowed them, wyth theyr housholdes and theyr tentes, Ꟶ all theyr substance that was in theyr possession, in the myddes of Israel.
Deut.11.7	Doutles, youre eyes haue sene all the greate actes of the Lorde whych he dyd.
Deut.11.8	Therfore shall ye kepe all the commaundmentes, whych I commaunde the thys daye, that ye maye be stronge Ꟶ go in and conquere the lande whether ye go to possesse it,
Deut.11.9	Ꟶ that ye maye prolonge youre dayes in the lande which the Lorde sware vnto your fathers, to geue vnto them and to theyr seed, a lande that floweth wyth mylcke and honye.
Deut.11.10	For the lande whether thou goest to possesse it, is not as the lande of Egypte that ye came out of, where thou sowedst thy seed and wateredst it wyth thy fete as a garden of herbes:
Deut.11.11	but the lande whyther ye go ouer to possesse it, is a lande that hath hylles and valeyes, and drinketh water of the rayne of heauen.
Deut.11.12	Thys lande doth the Lorde thy God care for, Ꟶ the eyes of the Lorde thy God are alwayes vpon it, from the begynnynge of the yeare, vnto the ende of the yeare.
Deut.11.13	If you shall herken therfore vnto my commaundementes, whych I commaunde you thys daye, that ye loue the Lorde youre God Ꟶ serue him wyth all youre herte, Ꟶ wyth all youre soul
Deut.11.14	I also wyll geue rayne vnto youre lande in due ceason: the fyrst rayne and the later, that thou mayest gather in thy corne, thy wyne Ꟶ thyne oyle.
Deut.11.15	And I will sende grasse in thy feldes for thy catell: that thou mayest eate, and fyll thy selfe.
Deut.11.16	But beware that youre herte deceaue you not Ꟶ ye turne asyde, and serue straunge Goddes, and worshyp them,
Deut.11.17	and then the Lord beynge wroth agaynst you, shutt vp the heauen, that there be no rayne, and that youre lande yelde not her frute, and lest ye perysh quickly from of the good lande, whych the Lorde geueth you.
Deut.11.18	Therfore shall ye put vp these my wordes in youre herte and in youre soule, Ꟶ bynde them for a sygne vpon youre hande, that they maye be as a warninge betwene your eyes,
Deut.11.19	and ye shall teach them youre children that they maye talke of them, when thou syttest in thyne house, and when thou walkest by the waye: when thou lyest downe, Ꟶ when thou rysest vp:
Deut.11.20	yee and thou shalt wryte them vpon the dore postes of thyne house, and vpon thy gates,
Deut.11.21	that your dayes maye be multiplied, Ꟶ the dayes of youre children, in the land whych the Lorde sware vnto youre fathers to geue them, as longe as the dayes of heauen last vpon the erth.
Deut.11.22	For yf ye kepe all these commaundmentes, which I commaund you so that ye do them: Namely, that ye loue the Lord youre God, Ꟶ walke in all his wayes, and cleaue vnto him,
Deut.11.23	Then wyll the Lorde cast out all these nacyons before you, and ye shalbe the heyres of great nacions and of them that are myghtyer then youre selues.
Deut.11.24	All the places where on the soles of youre fete shall treade, shalbe youres, euen from the wildernesse and from Libanno, Ꟶ from the ryuer Euphrates, euen vnto the vttemost see, shall youre coaste be.
Deut.11.25	There shall no man be able to stande before you: for the Lorde youre God shall cast the feare Ꟶ dreade of you vpon all the lande that ye shall treade vpon, as he hath sayde vnto you.
Deut.11.26	Beholde, I set before you thys daye, a blessynge Ꟶ a curs
Deut.11.27	a blessynge: yf ye obeye the commaundmentes of the Lorde youre God whych I commaunde you thys daye.
Deut.11.28	And a curse: yf ye wyll not obeye the commaundmentes of the Lorde youre God: but turne out of the waye, whych I commaunde you thys daye, to go after straunge goddes, whych ye haue not knowen.
Deut.11.29	When the Lorde thy God therfore hath brought the in to the lande, whether thou goest to possesse it, thou shalt put the blessynge vpon mount Garizim, Ꟶ the curse vpon mount Ebal,
Deut.11.30	whych (mountaynes) are on the other syde Iordan on the backe syde of the waye towarde the goynge doune of the sonne, in the lande of the Cananites whych dwel in the playne ouer agaynst Gilgal besyde the groue of Moreh.
Deut.11.31	For ye shall passe ouer Iordane, to go in, and possesse the lande, which the Lorde your God geueth you, and ye shall conquere it, Ꟶ dwell therin.
Deut.11.32	Take hede therfore that ye do all the commaundementes and lawes, whych I sett before you thys daye.
Deut.12.1	These are the ordinaunces and lawes which ye shall obserue and do in the lande, whych the Lord God of thy fathers geueth the to possesse it, as longe as ye lyue vpon the erth.
Deut.12.2	Ye shall destroye all places where in the nacions which ye shall conquere serued their Goddes, vpon hye mountaynes, on hylles, and vnder euery thyck tree.
Deut.12.3	Ouerthrowe theyr alters, and breake theyr pilers, and burne their groues with fyre and hewe downe the grauen ymages of the Goddes that they haue, and bringe the names of them to noughte out of that place.
Deut.12.4	Ye shall not do so vnto the Lorde youre God,
Deut.12.5	but ye shall seke the place, whych the Lorde youre God shall haue chosen out of all youre trybes, to put hys name there, Ꟶ there to dwell.
Deut.12.6	And thyther thou shalt come, and thyther ye shall brynge youre burnt sacrifyces, your offrynges, youre tythes, and heue offrynges of youre hande, youre vowes, your frewill offerynges and the fyrst gendred of youre oxen and of your shepe.
Deut.12.7	And there ye shall eate before the Lorde youre God, Ꟶ ye shall reioyse in all that ye put youre hande vnto both ye and youre housholdes, wherin the Lord thy God hath blessed the.
Deut.12.8	Ye shall not do after all the thynges that we do here thys daye, euery man what semeth hym good in hys awne eyes.
Deut.12.9	For ye are not yet come to rest, Ꟶ to the enheritaunce, which the Lorde youre God geueth you.
Deut.12.10	But whan ye go ouer Iordan, and dwell in the lande whych the Lorde your God hath geuen you to enheret, and whan he hath geuen you rest from all youre enemyes rounde aboute, so that ye dwel in safetye,
Deut.12.11	then vnto the place whych the Lorde youre God hath chosen, to put his name there, ye shall brynge all that I commaunde you: Namely, youre burntsacrifyces, youre offerynges, youre tythes, the heueofferinge of youre hande, Ꟶ all youre speciall vowes, which ye vowe vnto the Lord.
Deut.12.12	And ye shall reioyse before the Lorde youre God, ye and youre sonnes, Ꟶ youre daughters, youre seruauntes and youre maydens, and the Leuite that is wythin youre gates for asmoch as he hath no parte nor enheritaunce wyth you.
Deut.12.13	Take hede that thou offer not thy burntofferynges in euery place that thou seest:
Deut.12.14	but in the place whych the Lorde shall haue chosen in one of thy trybes, there thou shalt offer thy burntofferinges, and there thou shalt do all that I commaunde the.
Deut.12.15	Notwythstandynge thou mayst kyll and eate fleshe in all thy cyties, whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after, accordynge to the blessinge of the Lorde thy God, which he hath geuen the both the vncleane and the cleane may eat therof, euen as the roo, or the hert:
Deut.12.16	only ye shall not eate the bloud, but powre it vpon the erth as water.
Deut.12.17	Thou mayst not eate wythin thy gates the tithe of thy corne, of thy wyne and of thy oyle, and the fyrst gendred of thine oxen, and of thy shepe, nether any of thy vowes whych thou vowest, nor thy fre wil offringes or heueofferynge of thyne hande:
Deut.12.18	but thou must eate them before the Lorde thy God, in the place which the Lorde thy God hath chosen: thou, and thy sonne, and thy daughter, thy seruaunte and thy mayde, Ꟶ the Leuite that is wythin thy gates: and thou shalt reioyse before the Lorde thy God, in all that thou puttest thyne hande to.
Deut.12.19	Beware, that thou forsake not the Leuite, as longe as thou lyuest vpon the erth.
Deut.12.20	If (when the Lorde thy God hath enlarged thy border as he hath promised the) thou saye: I wyll eate flessh, because thy soule longeth to eate fleshe: thou mayest eate fleshe whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth.
Deut.12.21	If the place whych the Lorde thy God hath chosen to put his name there, be to farre from the, then thou shalt kyll of thy oxen Ꟶ of thy shepe which the Lord hath geuen the, as I haue commaunded the, Ꟶ thou shalt eate in thine awne cytie, whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth.
Deut.12.22	And as the roo Ꟶ the herte is eaten, euen so thou shalt eate them: both the cleane and the vncleane shall eate of them.
Deut.12.23	But be stronge that thou eate not the bloude. For the bloude, that is the lyfe, and thou mayst not eate the lyfe wyth the fleshe:
Deut.12.24	thou shalt not eate it, but powre it vpon the erth as water.
Deut.12.25	Se thou eate it not, that it maye go well wyth the, and wyth thy chyldren after the: But thou shalt do that, which is ryght in the syghte of the Lorde.
Deut.12.26	But thy holye thinges which thou hast, and thy vowes thou shalt take, Ꟶ come vnto the place which the Lorde hath chosen,
Deut.12.27	and thou shalt offer thy burntoffringes, both fleshe and bloude vpon the alter of the Lorde thy God, and the bloude of thyne offeringes shalbe powred out vpon the alter of the Lord thy God, Ꟶ thou shalt eate the flesh.
Deut.12.28	Take hede, Ꟶ heare all these wordes whych I commaunde the, that it maye go well wyth the, and wyth thy chyldren after the for euer, yf thou doest that whych is good and ryght in the syghte of the Lorde thy God.
Deut.12.29	When the Lorde thy God hath destroyed the nacyons before the, whether thou goest to conquere them, Ꟶ thou succedest in theyr inheritaunce, and dwellest in theyr lande:
Deut.12.30	Beware, that thou be not taken in a snare after them, after that they be destroyed before the, and that thou aske not after theyr Goddes, sayinge: howe dyd these nacyons serue their Goddes? I wyll do so lyke wise.
Deut.12.31	Nay, thou shalt not do so vnto the Lorde thy God: for all abhominacions, Ꟶ that whych the Lord hateth, the same haue they done vnto theyr Goddes. For they burne both theyr sonnes and theyr daughters wyth fyre before theyr Goddes.
Deut.12.32	Therfore whatsoeuer I commaunde you, that take hede ye do and put thou nought therto, nor take ought therfrom.
Deut.13.1	If there a ryse amonge you a prophete or a dreamer of dreames, and geue the a sygne, or a wonder,
Deut.13.2	and that sygne or wonder whych he hath sayde come to passe, and then saye: let vs go after straunge Goddes whych thou hast not knowen, and let vs serue them
Deut.13.3	herken not thou vnto the wordes of that prophete or dreamer of dreames. For the Lorde thy God proueth you, to wete, whether ye loue the Lorde youre God wyth all youre herte and with all your soule.
Deut.13.4	Ye shall walke after the Lorde youre God, and feare him, kepe his commaundmentes, and herken vnto hys voyce, serue him, and cleaue vnto hym.
Deut.13.5	And that prophete or dreamer of dreames shall dye, because he hath spoken to turne you a waye from the Lorde youre God, (which brought you out of the lande of Egypte, and delyuered you out of the house of bondage) to thrust the out of the waye, which the Lorde thy God commaunded the to walke in: and therfore thou shalt put the euell a waye from the.
Deut.13.6	If thy brother, the sonne of thy mother, or thyne awne sonne, or thy daughter, or the wyfe that lyeth in thy bosome, or thy frende which is as thyne awne soule vnto the, entice the secretly, saying: let vs go Ꟶ serue straunge Goddes, whych thou hast not knowen nor yet thy fathers,
Deut.13.7	And they be of the Goddes of the people which are rounde aboute you, whether they be nye vnto the or farre of from the, from the one ende of the erth vnto the other,
Deut.13.8	Thou shalt not consente vnto him, nor herken vnto him: thine eye shall not pitie him nether shalt thou haue compassion on him, nor kepe him secret but cause him to be slayne.
Deut.13.9	Thyne hande shalbe fyrst vpon him to kyll hym: Ꟶ then the handes of all the people.
Deut.13.10	And thou shalt stone him wyth stones that he dye, because he hath gone aboute to thrust the awaye from the Lorde thy God, which brought the out of the lande of Egipte, and from the house of bondage.
Deut.13.11	And all Israel shall heare and feare, and shall do no moare any soche wyckednesse as this is, amonge you.
Deut.13.12	If thou shalt heare saye in one of thy cyties which the Lorde thy God hath geuen the to dwell in,
Deut.13.13	that certen men beynge the chyldren of Belial, are gone out from amonge you, and haue moued the enhabiters of their cytie, sayinge: let vs go and serue straunge Goddes, which ye haue not knowen.
Deut.13.14	Then thou must seke, and make serche and enquere diligently. And beholde, yf it be true, and the thynge of a suertye, that soche abhominacion is wrought among you:
Deut.13.15	then thou shalt smyte the dwellers of that cytie in the edge of the swerde, and destroye it vtterly, and all that is therin, and euen the very catell therof with the edge of the swerde.
Deut.13.16	And gether all the spoyle of it into the myddes of the streate therof, and burne with fyre both the cytie Ꟶ all the spoyle therof euery white for the Lorde thy God. And it shalbe an heape for euer Ꟶ shall not be bylt agayne.
Deut.13.17	And there shall cleaue naught of the damned thynge in thine hande, that the Lorde maye turne from the fearcenesse of hys wrath, and shewe the mercye, and haue compassyon on the, and multiplye the, as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers.
Deut.13.18	Therfore shalt thou herken vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God, to kepe all hys commaundmentes, whych I commaunde the this daye, that thou do it, which is ryght in the eyes of the Lorde thy God.
Deut.14.1	Ye are the children of the Lord your God. Ye shall not cut youre selues, nor make you any baldnes betwene youre eyes for any deed man.
Deut.14.2	For thou art an holy people vnto the Lorde thy God, and the Lorde hath chosen the, to be a seuerall people vnto hym selfe, aboue all the nacyons that are vpon the erth.
Deut.14.3	Thou shalt eate no maner of abhominacion.
Deut.14.4	These are the beastes which ye shall eate of oxen, shepe and goates,
Deut.14.5	hert, roo and bugle: wildegoate, vnicorne, wylde oxen Ꟶ Camelion.
Deut.14.6	And all beastes that cleaue the hoffe, and slytte it into two clawes, and chewe the cud, them ye shall eate.
Deut.14.7	Neuerthelesse, these ye shall not eate of them that chewe cud and of them that deuyde and cleaue the hoffe: the camell, the hare and the conye: whych chewe cud, but deuyde not the hoffe: therfore are they vncleane vnto you:
Deut.14.8	and also the swine, though he deuide the hoffe, yet he cheweth not cud, therfore is he vncleane vnto you: ye shall not eate of the flesh of soche, nor touche the dead carkesse of them.
Deut.14.9	These ye shall eate of all that are in the waters: All that haue fynnes Ꟶ scales shall ye eate:
Deut.14.10	And whatsoeuer hath not fynnes Ꟶ scales, of that ye maye not eate, but it is vncleane vnto you.
Deut.14.11	Of all cleane byrdes ye shall eate:
Deut.14.12	but these are they of whych ye shall not eate: the Egle, the goshauke, and the cormerant,
Deut.14.13	the Ixion, the vultur, the kyte after her kynde,
Deut.14.14	and all kynde of rauens,
Deut.14.15	the Estritch, the nyghtcrowe, the kuckowe, and the sparowe hawk after her kynde,
Deut.14.16	the lytle oule, the great oule, the back,
Deut.14.17	the bitture, the pye,
Deut.14.18	the storke, the heron, the Iay in his kynde, the lapwinge, the swaloue.
Deut.14.19	And let all crepinge foules be vncleane vnto you, and not be eaten of:
Deut.14.20	but of all cleane foules ye maye eate.
Deut.14.21	Ye shall eat of nothynge that dyeth alone: But thou shalt geue it vnto the straunger that is in thy cytie, that he eate it, or thou mayst sel it vnto an Aliant. For thou art an holy people vnto the Lorde thy God. Thou shalt not sethe a kyd in hys mothers mylcke.
Deut.14.22	Thou shalt tythe all the encrease of thy seed, that the felde bryngeth furth yeare by yeare:
Deut.14.23	And thou shalt eate before the Lorde thy God, (in the place whych he hath chosen, and where he hath put his name) the tythe of thy corne, of thy wyne Ꟶ of thyne oyle, and the fyrst gendred of thyne oxen Ꟶ of thy shepe, that thou mayst learne to feare the Lorde thy God all waye:
Deut.14.24	If the waye be to longe for the, so that thou art not able to carye it, Ꟶ yf the place be farre from the, which the Lord thy God hath chosen to set his name there (and the Lord thy God hath blessed the)
Deut.14.25	then shalt thou make it in money, Ꟶ take the money in thyne hande, Ꟶ go vnto the place whych the Lorde thy God hath chosen,
Deut.14.26	and bestowe the money for whatsoeuer thy soule lusteth after: for oxen, Ꟶ shepe, wyne Ꟶ stronge drynke, Ꟶ for whatsoeuer thy soule desyreth, and eate there before the Lorde thy God and be mery. bothe thou and thyne housholde,
Deut.14.27	and the Leuite that is wythin thy gates, shalt thou not forsake, for he hath nether parte nor enheritaunce wyth the.
Deut.14.28	At the ende of thre yeare, thou shalt brynge forth all the tythes of thyne encrease the same yeare, and laye it vp wythin thyne awne gates.
Deut.14.29	And the Leuite whych hath no parte nor enheritaunce with the, shall come, Ꟶ the straunger, the fatherlesse and the wedowe, which are within thy gates, shall eate Ꟶ be fylled: that the Lorde thy God maye blesse the, in all the workes of thyne hande which thou doest.
Deut.15.1	In the seuenth yeare thou shalt make a fredome. And this is the maner of the fredom
Deut.15.2	whosoeuer lendeth ought wyth hys hande vnto his neyghboure, maye not aske againe (that whych he hath lent) of hys neyghboure or of his brother: because it is called the Lordes fre yeare:
Deut.15.3	yet of a straunger thou mayst call it home agayne. But he that is thy brother, him shall thyne hande remytt,
Deut.15.4	Neuertheles there shall be no begger amonge you. For the Lord shall blesse the in the lande, whych the Lorde thy God geueth the, an enheritaunce to possesse it:
Deut.15.5	so that thou herken vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God, to obserue and do all these commaundmentes, which I commaunde the this daye.
Deut.15.6	For the Lorde thy God hath blessed the as he hath promysed the, and thou shalt lende vnto many nacyons, but thou thy selfe shalt not borowe: And thou shalt raygne ouer many nacions, and they shall not raygne ouer the.
Deut.15.7	Yf one of thy brethren amonge you be poore wythin any of thy gates in thy lande which the Lorde thy God geueth the, thou shalt not harden thine hert, nor shut to thyne hande from thy poore brother:
Deut.15.8	But open thyne hande vnto him, Ꟶ lende hym sufficient for his nede, which he hath.
Deut.15.9	Beware, that there be not a wycked poynte in thine hert, that thou woldest saye: The seuenth yeare, the yeare of fredome is at hande, and therfore it greueth the to loke on thy poore brother, and geuest him naught Ꟶ he then crye vnto the Lord against the, and it be synne vnto the:
Deut.15.10	But geue him, and let it not greue thyne hert to geue vnto him. Because that for thys thynge, the Lord thy God shall blesse the in all thy workes, Ꟶ in all that thou puttest thyne hande to.
Deut.15.11	The lande shall neuer be wtout poore: And therfore I commaunde the sayinge: Thou shalt open thyne hande vnto thy brother that is neady and poore in thy lande.
Deut.15.12	If thy brother an Hebrue sell hym selfe to the, or an Hebruesse, Ꟶ serue the sixe yeare, in the seuenth yeare thou shalt let hym go fre from the.
Deut.15.13	And when thou sendest him out fre from the, thou shalt not let hym go awaye emptye:
Deut.15.14	but shalt geue hym of thy shepe, of thy corne, and of thy wyne, and geue hym of that, wher wt the Lorde thy God hath blessed the.
Deut.15.15	And remembre, that thou wast a seruante in the lande of Egypte, and the Lorde thy God delyuered the thence: and therfore I commaunde the thys thynge to daye.
Deut.15.16	And yf he saye vnto the I wyll not go awaye from the, because he loueth the Ꟶ thyne house, and is well at ease with the:
Deut.15.17	Then shalt thou take an aule, and nayle his eare to the doore therwith, Ꟶ let hym be thy seruaunte for euer: And vnto thy mayde seruaunte thou shalt do lyke wise.
Deut.15.18	And let it not greue thyne eye, whan thou lettest him go out fre from the, for he hath bene worth a double hyred seruaunte to the in hys seruice syxe yeres, And the Lorde thy God shall blesse the in all that thou doest.
Deut.15.19	All the fyrst gendred that come of thyne oxen, and of thy shepe that are males, thou shalt halowe vnto the Lord thy God. Thou shalt do no worke with the fyrst gendred of thyne oxen, ner shere the fyrst gendred of thy shepe:
Deut.15.20	Thou shalt eate it before the Lord thy God yeare by yeare, in the place whych the Lorde hath chosen, both thou and thyne housholde.
Deut.15.21	If there be any deformyte therin, as yf it be lame, or blynde, or haue any other euell fauorednesse, thou shalt not offer it vnto the Lord thy God:
Deut.15.22	But shalt eate it within thyne awne gates, the vncleane and the cleane indifferently, as the roo Ꟶ the hert.
Deut.15.23	Only eate not the bloude therof, but poure it vpon the grounde as water.
Deut.16.1	Obserue the moneth of newe corne, that thou mayest offer passeouer vnto the Lorde thy God. For in the moneth whan corne beginneth to rype, the Lorde thy God brought the out of Egypte by nyght.
Deut.16.2	Thou shalt therfore offer passe ouer vnto the Lorde thy God (and shepe and oxen) in the place whych the Lorde shall chose to put his name there.
Deut.16.3	Thou shalt eate no leuened bread with it: but seuen dayes shalt thou eate vnleuened bred therwith: euen the bread of trybulacyon (for thou camest out of the lande of Egypte in haste) that thou mayst remembre the daye, when thou camest out of the lande of Egypte, all dayes of thy lyfe.
Deut.16.4	And there shall be no leuened bread sene in all thy coastes seuen dayes longe, neyther shall there remayne any thynge of the fleshe which thou offrest the fyrst daye at euen, vntyll the mornynge.
Deut.16.5	Thou mayst not offer passeouer wythin any of thy gates, whych the Lorde thy God geueth the:
Deut.16.6	but in the place which the Lord thy God shall chose, to set his name in, there thou shalt offer Passeouer at euen, aboute the goynge downe of the sonne, euen in the ceason that thou camest out of Egypte.

Deut.28.51	The same shall eate the frute of thy catell, and the frute of thy londe, vntyll he haue destroyed the: and shall leaue the nether corne, wyne, nor oyle, nether the encrease of thyne oxen, nor the flockes of thy shepe: vntyll he haue brought the to nought.
Deut.28.52	And he shall kepe the in, in all thy cyties, vntyll he haue cast downe thy hye walles and stronge holdes, wherin thou trustedst, thorowe out all the lande. And he shall besege the in all thy cyties thorowe out all thy lande, whych the Lorde thy God hath geuen the.
Deut.28.53	And thou shalt eate the frute of thyne awne bodye: the fleshe of thy sonnes, and of thy daughters, whych the Lorde thy God hath geuen the, in that straytenesse and sege, wherwith thyne enemye shall besege the:
Deut.28.54	so that it shall greue the man (that is tender Ꟶ exceadynge delycate amonge you,) to loke on hys brother and vpon hys wyfe that lyeth in hys bosome, and on the remnaunte of hys chyldren, whych he hath yet lefte:
Deut.28.55	for feare of geuynge (vnto anye of them) of the fleshe of hys chyldren, whom he shall eate, because he hath nothynge left hym in that straytenesse Ꟶ sege, wherwith thyne enemye shall besege the in all thy cyties.
Deut.28.56	Yee and the woman that is so tender and delycate, that she dare not aduenture to set the sole of her foote vpon the grounde, (for softnesse and tendernesse) shalbe greued to loke on her husbande that lyeth in her bosome, Ꟶ on her sonne and on her daughter:
Deut.28.57	and on hyr after byrthe (that is come out from betwene her legges,) and her chyldren whych she shall beare: For whan all thynges lack, she shall eat them secretly, in the sege Ꟶ straytenesse, wherwith thyne enemye shall besege the in thy cyties.
Deut.28.58	If thou wylt not kepe and do all the wordes of thys lawe (that are wrytten in thys boke,) and feare thys gloryous and fearfull name of the Lorde thy God:
Deut.28.59	the Lorde will sende vnto the and thy seed, greate plages and of longe continuaunce,
Deut.28.60	euell sycknesses and of longe duraunce. Moreouer he will bringe vpon the all the diseases of Egypte, and those whych thou wast afrayed of shall cleaue vnto the.
Deut.28.61	And all maner syckenesses, and all maner plages whych are not wrytten in the boke of thys lawe, wyll the Lorde brynge vpon the, vntyll he bringe the to noughte.
Deut.28.62	And ye shalbe lefte fewe in nombre, where before ye were as the starres of heauen in multytude: because thou woldest not herken vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God.
Deut.28.63	And it shall come to passe, that as the Lord reioysed ouer you, to do you good, Ꟶ to multiplye you: euen so he wyll reioyse ouer you, to destroye you, Ꟶ to brynge you to nought. And ye shalbe wasted from of the land, whether thou goest to enioye it.
Deut.28.64	And the Lorde shall scater the amonge all nacions, from the one ende of the worlde vnto the other, and there thou shalt serue straunge goddes, whych thou nor thy fathers haue knowne: euen wodd and stone.
Deut.28.65	And amonge these nacyons thou shalt fynde no ease, neyther shall the sole of thy foote haue rest. But the Lorde shall geue the there an vnquyet herte, and dasyng eyes, and sorowe of mynde.
Deut.28.66	And thy lyfe shall hange before the and thou shalt feare both daye, and nyghte, Ꟶ shalt haue no trust in thy lyfe.
Deut.28.67	In the mornynge thou shalt saye, wolde God it were nyght. And at nyght thou shalt saye: wolde God it were mornynge: for feare, of thyne harte whych thou shall feare Ꟶ for the syghte of thyne eyes, whych thou shalt se.
Deut.28.68	And the Lorde shall brynge the into Egipt agayne wyth shyppes, by the waye which I bad the, that thou shuldest se it no moare. And there ye shalbe solde vnto youre enemies, for bondmen and bondwemen: Ꟶ no man shall bye you.
Deut.29.1	These are the wordes of the appoyntment, which the Lorde commaunded Moses, to make wyth the chyldren of Israel in the lande of Moab, besyde the appoyntment which he made wyth them in Horeb,
Deut.29.2	and Moses called all Israel, and sayde vnto them: Ye haue sene all that the Lorde dyd before youre eyes in the lande of Egipt, vnto Pharao and vnto all hys seruauntes, and vnto all hys lande,
Deut.29.3	the greate temptacions which thyne eyes haue sene, those greate myracles and wonders:
Deut.29.4	and yet the Lorde hath not geuen you an herte to perceaue, and eyes to se, and eares to heare vnto thys daye.
Deut.29.5	And I haue led you .xl. yeare in the wyldernesse: and youre clothes are not waxed olde vpon you, and thy showe is not waxed olde vpon thy fote.
Deut.29.6	Ye haue eaten no bread, nor droncke wyne or stronge dryncke, that ye myghte knowe, howe that I am the Lord youre God.
Deut.29.7	And ye came vnto this place, Ꟶ Sehon the kynge of Hesbon, and Og kynge of Basan came out agaynst vs vnto battell, and we smote them,
Deut.29.8	and toke theyr lande, Ꟶ gaue it for an inheritaunce vnto the Rubenites Ꟶ Gadites, and to the halfe trybe of Manasse.
Deut.29.9	kepe therfore the wordes of this appoyntment and do them, that ye maye vnderstande all that ye ought to do.
Deut.29.10	Ye stande thys daye euery one of you before the Lorde your God: youre captaynes, youre trybes, your elders, youre offycers, and all the men of Israel:
Deut.29.11	youre chyldren also, youre wyues Ꟶ the straunger that is in thyne hoste from the hewer of thy wodd, vnto the drawer of thy water:
Deut.29.12	that thou shuldest go into the appoyntment of the Lord thy God, Ꟶ into his othe which the Lord thy God maketh wyth the this daye.
Deut.29.13	For to make the a people vnto him selfe, and that he maye be vnto the a God, as he hath sayde vnto the, and as he hath sworne vnto thy fathers Abraham, Isahac and Iacob.
Deut.29.14	I make not thys bonde Ꟶ this othe wyth you only:
Deut.29.15	but both wyth hym that standeth here wyth vs this daye before the Lord oure God, and also wyth hym that is not here with vs this daye.
Deut.29.16	For ye knowe, howe we haue dwelt in the lande of Egypte, and how we came thorowe the myddes of the nacions whych ye passed by.
Deut.29.17	And ye haue sene theyr abhominacyons and theyr ydolles: (wod Ꟶ stone, syluer and golde) whych were amonge them.
Deut.29.18	Lest there be amonge you man or woman, kynred or trybe, whose hert turneth awaye this daye from the Lorde oure God, to go and serue the goddes of these nacyons: Ꟶ lest there be amonge you some roote that beareth gall Ꟶ worm wod,
Deut.29.19	so that when he heareth the wordes of thys ooth, he blesse hym selfe in hys hert, sayinge. I shall haue peace. I wyll walke in the meanynge of myne owne hert, (Thou put the dronken to the thyrstye.)
Deut.29.20	And so the Lorde wyll not consent to be mercyfull vnto hym, but then the wrath of the Lorde and hys gelousye shall smoke agaynst that man, Ꟶ all the curses that are wryten in this boke shall lyght vpon hym, and the Lorde shall do out hys name from vnder heauen,
Deut.29.21	and the Lorde shall separate him vnto euell out of all the tribes of Israel, accordyng vnto all the curses of the appoyntment, that are wrytten in the boke of thys lawe.
Deut.29.22	So that the generacyon to come of youre chyldren, that shall ryse vp after you, and the straunger that shall come from a farre lande shall saye, when they se the plages of that lande, and the diseases wherwith the Lorde hath smytten it,
Deut.29.23	howe all the lande is burnt vp with brymstone Ꟶ salt, Ꟶ that it is nether sowen nor beareth, nor any grasse groweth therin, lyke as in the place of the ouerthrowynge of Sodome, Gomor, Adama, Ꟶ zeboim: whych the Lorde ouerthrewe in hys wrath and angre:
Deut.29.24	Euen then shall all nacions saye: wherfore hath the Lorde done of this facyon vnto thys lande? O howe fearse is thys great wrath?
Deut.29.25	And men shalt saye: because they lefte the testament of the Lorde God of theyr fathers whych he made with them, when he brought them out of the lande of Egypt.
Deut.29.26	For they went, and serued straunge goddes, Ꟶ worshipped them: Goddes whych they knewe not, and whych had geuen them nought.
Deut.29.27	And the wrath of the Lorde waxed whote agaynst thys lande, to brynge vpon it all the curses that are written in this boke.
Deut.29.28	And the Lorde cast them out of theyr lande in angre, wrath, and greate indignacyon, and cast them into a straunge lande, as this daye beareth wytnesse.
Deut.29.29	The secrettes of the Lorde oure God are opened vnto vs, and to oure chyldren for euer, that we maye do all the wordes of thys lawe.
Deut.30.1	When all these wordes are come vpon the, the blessynge and the curse which I haue set before the, thou shalt turne vnto thine hert, amonge all the nacyons whether the Lorde thy God hath thruste the,
Deut.30.2	and come agayne vnto the Lorde thy God, and herken vnto his voyce in all these thynges that I commaunde the thys daye: thou Ꟶ thy chyldren wythall thyne herte and all thy soule:
Deut.30.3	And the Lord thy God wyll turne thy captiuite, and haue compassyon vpon the, Ꟶ wyll turne, and fet the agayne from all the nacions, amonge whych the Lorde thy God shall haue scatered the.
Deut.30.4	Though thou wast cast vnto the extreme partes of heauen: euen from thence wyll the Lorde thy God gether the, Ꟶ from thence wyll he fett the,
Deut.30.5	Ꟶ the Lorde thy God wyll brynge the into the lande whych thy fathers possessed, Ꟶ thou shalt enioye it. And he wyll shewe the kyndnesse, and multiplie the aboue thy fathers.
Deut.30.6	And the Lorde thy God wyll circumcyse thyne hert, and the hert of thy seed, that thou mayest loue the Lord thy God wythall thyne hert, and all thy soule, that thou mayst lyue.
Deut.30.7	And the Lord thy God wyll put all these curses vpon thyne enemyes, and on them that hate the, Ꟶ that persecute the.
Deut.30.8	But thou shalt turne, and herken vnto the voyce of the Lorde, and do all hys commaundementes, which I commaunde the thys daye.
Deut.30.9	And the Lord thy God wyll make the plenteous in all the workes of thyne hande, in the frute of thy bodye, and in the frute of thy catell, and in the frute of thy lande for thy welth. For the Lorde wyll turne agayne and reioyse ouer the to do the good, as he reioysed ouer thy fathers:
Deut.30.10	If thou herken onely vnto the voyce of the Lord thy God, to kepe his commaundementes and his ordinaunces whych are wrytten in the boke of this lawe, and yf thou turne vnto the Lorde thy God wythall thyne hert and all thy soule.
Deut.30.11	For the commaundement which I commaunde the this daye, is not separated from the, nether farre of.
Deut.30.12	It is not in heauen, that thou neadest to saye: who shall go vp for vs to heauen, and fet it vs, that we maye heare it, and do it?
Deut.30.13	Nether is it beyonde the see: that thou shuldest saye: who shall go ouer the see for vs, and fet it vs, that we maye heare it, and do it?
Deut.30.14	But the worde is very nye vnto the: euen in thy mouth and in thyne hert, that thou do it.
Deut.30.15	Beholde I haue set before the this daye lyfe and good, death and euell:
Deut.30.16	For where as I commaunde the thys daye, to loue the Lorde thy God, to walke in hys wayes, and to kepe hys commaundementes, his ordinaunces, and hys lawes (yf thou so do) thou shalt lyue and multiplye, and the Lorde thy God shall blesse the in that lande, whether thou goest to possesse it.
Deut.30.17	But and yf thyne herte turne awaye, so that thou wylt not heare: but shalt goo astraye, and worshyppe straunge goddes, and serue them,
Deut.30.18	I pronounce vnto you also this daye, that ye shall surely perysh, and that ye shall not prolonge youre dayes vpon the lande whether thou passest ouer Iordan, to go and possesse it.
Deut.30.19	I call heauen Ꟶ erth to recorde this daye agaynst you, that I haue set before you lyfe and death, blessynge Ꟶ cursynge: Therfore chose lyfe, that both thou and thy seed maye lyue,
Deut.30.20	that thou mayest loue the Lorde thy God, and be obedient to hys voyce, Ꟶ cleaue vnto him. For he is thy lyfe, and the length of thy dayes, that thou mayst dwell vpon the erth whych the Lorde sware vnto thy fathers: Abraham, Isahac and Iacob, to geue them.
Deut.31.1	And Moses went and spake these wordes vnto all Israel,
Deut.31.2	and sayd vnto them: I am an hundred and .xx. yeare olde thys daye, and can nomore go out and in. Also the Lorde hath sayde vnto me thou shalt not goo ouer thys Iordan.
Deut.31.3	The Lorde your God he wyll go ouer before the, and he wyll destroye these nacyons before the, Ꟶ thou shalt conquere them. And Iosua he shall go before the, as the Lorde hath sayde.
Deut.31.4	And the Lorde shall do vnto them, as he dyd to Seon and Og kynges of the Amorites, and vnto the lande of them, whom he destroyed.
Deut.31.5	And the Lorde shall geue them ouer before youre face, that ye maye do vnto them, accordinge vnto all the commaundementes which I haue commaunded you.
Deut.31.6	Plucke vp youre hartes therfore, and be stronge, dreade not, nor be aferde of them: for the Lord thy God him selfe doth go wyth the. He shall not fayle the, nor forsake the.
Deut.31.7	And Moses called vnto Iosua, and sayde vnto hym in the syghte of all Israel: Be stronge Ꟶ bolde, for thou must go with thys people vnto the lande, which the Lorde hath sworne vnto their fathers, to geue them, Ꟶ thou shalt geue it them to enheret.
Deut.31.8	And the Lorde he doth go before the: He shall not fayle the, neyther forsake the: feare not therfore, nor be discomforted.
Deut.31.9	And Moses wrote this lawe, and delyuered it vnto the preastes the sonnes of Leui (whych bare the arcke of the testament of the Lorde) and vnto all the elders of Israel,
Deut.31.10	Ꟶ Moses commaunded them, sayinge: At the poynt of .vij. yeares in the solempnyte of the fre yeare, euen in the feast of Tabernacles,
Deut.31.11	when all Israel is come to apeare before the Lord thy God, in the place whych he hath chosen: thou shalt reade thys lawe before all Israel in theyr eares.
Deut.31.12	Gether the people together: men, wemen and chyldren, and the straunger that is wythin thy gates, that they maye heare, and lerne and feare the Lorde your God, and kepe, and obserue all the wordes of thys lawe,
Deut.31.13	and that their chyldren whych knowe nothynge, maye heare, and lerne to feare the Lord your God, as longe as ye lyue in the lande, whether ye go ouer Iordan to possesse it.
Deut.31.14	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: Beholde thy dayes are come, that thou must dye. Call Iosua therfore, and stande ye in the tabernacle of wytnesse, that I maye geue hym a charge. And Moses and Iosua went, and stode in the tabernacle of wytnesse:
Deut.31.15	And the Lorde apeared in the tabernacle: euen in the pyller of the cloude. And the pyller of the cloude stode ouer the dore of the tabernacle.
Deut.31.16	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: beholde, thou shalt slepe wyth thy fathers, and thys people wyll ryse vp, and go a whorynge after straunge goddes of the lande (whether they go) and will forsake me, and breake the appoyntment, whych I haue made wyth them.
Deut.31.17	And then my wrath wyll waxe whote agaynst them, and I wyll forsake them, and wyll hyde my face from them, Ꟶ they shalbe consumed. And moch aduersyte and tribulacyons shall come vpon them, so that then they wyll saye: Are not these troubles come vpon me, because God is not wyth me?
Deut.31.18	And I also wyll surely hyde awaye my face in that daye, for all the euels sake whych they shall haue wrought in that they are turned vnto straunge Goddes.
Deut.31.19	Now therfore write ye thys songe for you, and teache it the chyldren of Israel, and put it in theyr mouthes, that thys songe maye be my wytnesse agaynst the chyldren of Israel.
Deut.31.20	For I wyll bryng them into the lande, (which I sware vnto theyr fathers) that floweth wt mylke and honye, Ꟶ they shall eate, and fyll them selues, and waxe fatt, and turne vnto straunge goddes, and serue them, and blaspheme me, and breake my couenaunt.
Deut.31.21	And then when moch myschefe and tribulacyon is come vpon them, thys songe shall answere them, as a wytnesse. For it shall not be forgotten out of the mouthes of theyr seed: for I knowe theyr imaginacyon, whych they goo about euen nowe, before I haue broughte them into the lande which I sware.
Deut.31.22	Moses therfore wrote thys songe the same ceason, and taught it the children of Israel.
Deut.31.23	And he gaue Iosua the sonne of Nun a charge, and sayd: be bolde, Ꟶ stronge, for thou shalt bryng the chyldren of Israel into the lande, whych I sware vnto them, and I wyll be with the.
Deut.31.24	And when Moses had made an ende of wrytynge out of the wordes of this lawe in a boke vnto the ende of them,
Deut.31.25	Moses commaunded the Leuites, whych bare the arke of the testament of the Lorde, sayinge:
Deut.31.26	take ye the boke of thys lawe, and put it in the syde of the arcke of the testament of the Lorde your God, that it maye be there for a witnesse against the:
Deut.31.27	For I knowe thy stuburnesse and thy styffe necke: whyle I am yet a lyue with you this daye, ye haue bene disobedient vnto the Lord: and howe moch more after my death?
Deut.31.28	Gather vnto me all the elders of youre trybes, Ꟶ youre offycers, that I maye speake these wordes in theyr eares, and call heauen, and erth to recorde agaynst them.
Deut.31.29	For I am sure that after my death, ye wyll vtterly be corrupte, and turne from the waye whych I haue commaunded you, and tribulacyon wyll come vpon you in the later dayes, because ye shall haue wrought wyckednesse in the syght of the Lorde, to prouoke hym thorow the workes of your handes.
Deut.31.30	And Moses spake in the eares of all the congregacion of Israel the wordes of thys songe, vntyll he had ended them.
Deut.32.1	Heare O ye heauens, Ꟶ I shall speake, and let the erth heare the wordes of my mouth,
Deut.32.2	My doctrine shall droppe as doeth the rayne, Ꟶ my speach shall flowe as dothe the dewe, as the shower vpon the herbes, Ꟶ as the droppes vpon the grasse.
Deut.32.3	For I wyll call on the name of the Lorde: Ascrybe ye honoure vnto oure God.
Deut.32.4	Perfecte is the worke of the most myghtye God: for all hys wayes are iudgement. He is a God of trueth, without wickednesse: ryghteous, and iust is he.
Deut.32.5	Frowardly haue they done against him thorowe their deformities: not his owne children, but a wycked Ꟶ frowarde generacyon.
Deut.32.6	Do ye so rewarde the Lorde, O foolyshe nacyon Ꟶ vnwyse? Is not he thy father Ꟶ thyne owner? hath he not made the, and ordeyned the?
Deut.32.7	Remembre the dayes of the worlde that is past: consydre the yeres from tyme to tyme. Aske thy father, and he wyll shewe the: thy elders, Ꟶ they wyll tell the.
Deut.32.8	When the most highest, deuyded the nacyons, and whan he separated the sonnes of Adam, he put the borders of the nacyons, fast by the multitude of the chyldren of Israel.
Deut.32.9	For the Lordes parte is hys folke, and Iacob is the porcyon of hys enheritaunce.
Deut.32.10	He founde him in a deserte lande, in a voyde grounde, Ꟶ in a rorynge wyldernesse. He led hym aboute, he gaue hym vnderstandynge, and kepte him as the apple of his eye.
Deut.32.11	As an egle that stereth vp her nest and flotereth ouer her younge, Ꟶ stretcheth out hir winges, so doth he take them vp, Ꟶ beareth them on his shoulders.
Deut.32.12	The Lorde alone was hys guyde, Ꟶ there was no straunge God wt him.
Deut.32.13	He caried him vp to an hye lande, that he myght eate the encrease of the feldes, And he fedd him wyth honye out of the rocke, and with oyle out of the most harde stone.
Deut.32.14	Wyth butter of kyne, Ꟶ mylcke of the shepe, wyth fat of the lambes and of fat rammes and he goates, with the fat of most plenteous wheate: and that thou myghtest drynke the most pure bloude of the grape.
Deut.32.15	But he that shulde haue bene vpryght, whan he waxed fatt, spurned with his hele. Thou art well fedd, thou art growen thick: thou art euen laden with fatnesse. And he forsoke God his maker, Ꟶ regarded not the God of his saluacyon.
Deut.32.16	They prouoked hym to angre with straunge goddes: euen wt abhominacyons prouoked they him
Deut.32.17	They offered vnto deuels, and not to God, euen to goddes whom they knewe not: to newe goddes that came newly vp, whom their fathers feared not.
Deut.32.18	Of the rocke that begat the, thou arte vnmyndefull, and hast forgotten God that made the.
Deut.32.19	The Lorde therfore sawe it, and was angrye, because of the prouokynge of hys sonnes and of hys daughters.
Deut.32.20	And he sayde: I wyll hyde my face from them, Ꟶ will se what their ende shall be. For they are a very fro warde generacion, chyldren in whom is no fayth.
Deut.32.21	They haue angred me wyth that whych is no God, and prouoked me wyth their vanyties. And I also wyll prouoke them with those whych are no people, I wyll anger them wyth a folyshe nacion.
Deut.32.22	For fyre is kyndled in my wrath, Ꟶ burneth vnto the botome of hell. And hath consumed the earth with her encrease, and sett a fyre the botoms of the mountaynes.
Deut.32.23	I will heape mischeues vpon them, Ꟶ wyll destroye them wyth myne arowes.
Deut.32.24	They shalbe burnt with hunger, and consumed wt heate, and with bytter destruccion: I wyll also sende the teeth of beastes vpon them, with the furiousnes of serpentes in the dust.
Deut.32.25	Without forth, shall the swerde robbe them of their chyldren: and within in the chamber, feare: both younge men and younge wemen and the suckelynges wyth the men of gray heades.
Deut.32.26	I haue sayde: I will skater them abrode, and make the remembraunce of them to ceasse from amonge men.
Deut.32.27	Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemye, lest their aduersaries shulde vtterly wythdrawe them selues, and lest they shulde saye: oure hye hande hath done all thys, and not the Lorde.
Deut.32.28	For it is a nacyon without forecast, nether is there any vnderstandynge in them:
Deut.32.29	O that they were wyse, and vnderstode thys, that they wolde consyder their later ende.
Deut.32.30	Howe shulde one chace a thousande, and two put ten thousande to flyghte: excepte their maker had solde them, and excepte the Lorde had shutt them vp?
Deut.32.31	For their God is not as oure God oure enemyes also themselues are iudges.
Deut.32.32	For their vyne is of the vinyarde of Sodome, and of the feldes of Gomorra: Theyr grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters be bytter.
Deut.32.33	Their wyne is the poyson of draggons Ꟶ the cruell gall of aspes.
Deut.32.34	Is not thys layde in store with me, Ꟶ sealed vp amonge my treasures?
Deut.32.35	Uengeaunce is myne, and I wyll rewarde: their fete shall slyde in due tyme. For the daye of their destruccyon is at hande, and the thynges that shall come vpon them make haste.
Deut.32.36	For the Lorde shall iudge hys people, and haue compassyon on hys seruauntes: whan he seyth that their power is gone, and that they be in a maner shut vp, or brought to naught and forsaken.
Deut.32.37	And he shall saye wher are their goddes? their God, in whom they trusted?
Deut.32.38	The fat of whose sacrifyces they dyd eate and drancke the wyne of their dryncke offringes? let them ryse vp and helpe you, and be youre proteccyon.
Deut.32.39	Se nowe, howe that I I alone am God, Ꟶ there is none but I: I kyll, and wyll make alyue: I wounde, and I wyll heale: nether is there any that can delyuer out of my hande.
Deut.32.40	For I wyll lyfte vp myne hande to heauen, and wyll saye: I lyue euer.
Deut.32.41	If I whett the edge of my swerde, Ꟶ myne hande take holde to do iustice, I wyll recompence vengeaunce on myne enemyes, Ꟶ wyll rewarde them that hate me.
Deut.32.42	I will make myne arowes droncke with bloude, and my swerde shall eate fleshe, Ꟶ that for the bloude of the slayne, Ꟶ for their captiuite, sens the begynnynge of the wrath of the enemye.
Deut.32.43	Prayse ye hethen his people, for he will auenge the bloude of hys seruauntes, Ꟶ wyll auenge hym of his aduersaries, and wylbe mercyfull vnto his lande, and to hys people.
Deut.32.44	And Moses came and spake all the wordes of thys songe in the eares of the people, he and Iosua the sonne of Nun.
