Amos.0.0	¶ The booke of the prophete Amos,
Amos.1.1	These are the sermons that were shewed vnto Amos, (which was one of the shepherdes at Thecua) vpon Israell, in the tyme of Osiah kinge of Iuda, and in the tyme of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioah kynge of Israel, two yeare before the earth quake.
Amos.1.2	And he sayde: The Lorde shall roare oute of Sion, and shewe his voyce from Ierusalem: so that the pastures of the shepherdes shalbe in a myserable case, Ꟶ the toppe of Charmel dryed vp.
Amos.1.3	Thus sayeth the Lorde: for thre and foure wyckednesses of Damascus, I will not spare her: because they haue throshed Galaad with yron flayles.
Amos.1.4	But I will sende a fyre into the house of Hazaell, the same shall consume the palaces of Benadab.
Amos.1.5	Thus will I breake the barres of Damascus, and rote out the inhabyter from the felde of Auen, And him that holdeth the scepter, out of the pleasaunt house: so that the people shalbe dryuen out of fayre Siria, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.1.6	Thus sayeth the Lord: For thre and foure wickednesses of Gaza, I will not spare her: because they make the presoners yet more captyue, and haue dryuen them into the lande of Edom.
Amos.1.7	Therfore will I sende a fyre into the walles of Gaza, whych shall deuoure her houses.
Amos.1.8	I will rote out them that dwell at Asdod and him that holdeth the scepter of Ascalon, and stretche out myne hande ouer Accaron, that the remnaunt of the Philistines shall peryshe, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.1.9	Thus sayeth the Lorde: For thre Ꟶ foure wickednesses of the cytie of Tyre, I wyll not spare her: because they haue increased the captiuyte of the Edomites, and haue not remembred the brotherly couenaunt.
Amos.1.10	Therfore, wyll I sende a fyre into the walles of Tyre, that shall consume her palaces.
Amos.1.11	Thus sayeth the Lord: For thre and foure wickednesses of Edom I wyll not spare hym, because he persecuted hys brother with the swerde, destroyed his mothers wombe, bare hatred very longe, and so kepte indignacion all waye by hym.
Amos.1.12	Therfore wyll I sende a fyre into Theman, which shall deuoure the palaces of Bosra.
Amos.1.13	Thus sayeth the Lorde: for thre Ꟶ foure wickednesses of the chyldren of Ammon, I wyll not spare them: because they rypt vp the wemen greate wyth chylde in Galaad, to make the borders of their landes the wyder.
Amos.1.14	Therfore, I will kyndle a fyre in the walles of Rabbath, that shall consume her palaces: with a greate crye, in the daye of batayll, in tempest and in the daye of storme:
Amos.1.15	so that their kynge shall go into captiuyte he Ꟶ hys prynces together, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.2.1	Thus sayeth the Lorde: For thre and foure wyckednesses of Moab, I wyll not spare hym: because he brent the bones of the kynge of Edom to asshes.
Amos.2.2	Therfore, wyll I sende a fyre into Moab, which shall consume the palaces of Carioth: so that Moab shall peryshe with noyse and the sounde of a shawme.
Amos.2.3	I wyll rote out the iudge from amonge them, Ꟶ slaye all hys prynces with him, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.2.4	Thus sayeth the Lorde: for thre and foure wyckednesses of Iuda, I wyll not spare him: because he hath cast a syde the lawe of the Lorde, and not kepte hys commaundementes: for why? they wolde nedes be disceaued with the lyes that theyr forefathers folowed.
Amos.2.5	Therfore, will I sende a fyre into Iuda, which shall consume the palaces of Ierusalem.
Amos.2.6	Thus sayeth the Lorde: For thre and foure wickednesses of Israel, I will not spare him because he hath solde the ryghteous for money, Ꟶ the poore for shoes.
Amos.2.7	They treade vpon poore mens heades, in the dust of the earth, Ꟶ croke the wayes of the meke. The sonne and the father go to the harlot, to dishonoure my holy name,
Amos.2.8	they lye besyde euery alter vpon clothes taken to pledge, and in the house of theyr goddes they dryncke the wyne of the oppressed.
Amos.2.9	Yet destroyed I the Amoryte before them, that was as hye as the Cedre trees, and as stronge as the okes: notwithstandynge I destroyed his frute from aboue and his rote from vnder:
Amos.2.10	Agayne, I brought you out of the lande of Egypt, Ꟶ led you fourty yeares thorowe the wildernes, that ye might haue the Amorites landes in possession.
Amos.2.11	I raysed vp prophetes amonge youre chyldren, and absteyners amonge youre yonge men. Is it not so, O ye chyldren of Israel, sayeth the Lorde?
Amos.2.12	But ye gaue the absteyners wyne to dryncke, yee, ye commaunded the prophetes sayinge. Prophecy not.
Amos.2.13	Beholde, I will crashe you in sonder, lyke as a wayne crassheth, that is full of sheaues:
Amos.2.14	so that the swifte shall not escape nether the stronge be able to do eny thynge: no, the gyaunte shall not saue his awne lyfe.
Amos.2.15	The archer shall not abyde, and the swyfte of fote shall not escape. The horsman shall not saue his lyfe,
Amos.2.16	and he that is as manly of stomack as a gyaunte, shall in that daye be fayne to runne his waye naked, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.3.1	Heare, what the Lord speaketh vnto you (O ye chyldren of Israel) namely, vnto all the trybes, whom I brought out of Egypt, and sayde:
Amos.3.2	you only haue I accepted from all the generacyons of the earth: therfore, will I viset you in all your wickednesses.
Amos.3.3	Maye twayne walke together excepte they be agreed amonge them selues?
Amos.3.4	Doth a lyon roare in the wodde, except he haue a praye? Or crieth a lyons whelpe out of his denne, excepte he haue gotten somthinge?
Amos.3.5	Doth a byrde fall in a snare vpon the earth where no fouler is? Taketh a man his snare vp from the grounde, afore he catche somwhat?
Amos.3.6	Crye they out Alarum with the trompet in the cytie, and the people not afrayed? Commeth there eny plage in a cytie without it be the Lordes doynge?
Amos.3.7	Nowe doth the Lorde God no maner of thinge, but he telleth his secrete before vnto hys seruauntes the prophetes.
Amos.3.8	When a lyon roareth, who wyll not be afrayed? Seinge then that the Lorde God him selfe speaketh, who wyll not prophecy?
Amos.3.9	Preach in the palaces at Asdod, and in the palaces of the lande of Egypt, and saye: gather you together vpon the mountaynes of Samaria, so shall ye se greate murther and violent oppressyon amonge them, for why? they regarde not the thinge that is ryght,
Amos.3.10	sayeth the Lorde: they gather together euell gotten goodes, and laye vp robbery in their houses:
Amos.3.11	Therfore, thus sayeth the Lorde God. This lande shalbe troubled and beseged rounde about, thy strength shalbe plucte from the, and thy palaces robbed.
Amos.3.12	Thus sayeth the Lorde. lyke as an heardman taketh two legges or a pece of an eare out of the lyons mouth: Euen so the chyldren of Israel (that dwell in Samaria) hauynge their couches in the corner, their beddes at Damascus, shalbe plucte awaye.
Amos.3.13	Heare, Ꟶ beare recorde in the house of Iacob (sayeth the Lorde God of hoostes)
Amos.3.14	that when I begynne to vyset the wyckednesse of Israel, I will vyset the aulters at Bethell also: so that the hornes of the aulter shalbe broken of, and fall to the grounde.
Amos.3.15	As for the wynterhouse Ꟶ sommerhouse I will smyte them downe: and the houses of yuery: yee, and many other houses shall peryshe, and be destroyed, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.4.1	O heare thys worde ye fat kyne, that be vpon the hyll of Samaria: ye that do poore men wronge, and oppresse the nedy: ye that saye to your lordes: brynge hyther, let vs drinke.
Amos.4.2	Therfore, the Lorde hath sworne by hys holynes: The dayes shall come vpon you, that the enemyes shall cary you away in shyppes, Ꟶ your posterite shalbe caryed awaye vpon fyshers hokes.
Amos.4.3	Ye shall get you out at the gappes one after another, euen the kynges palace shall you ouer throwe, to make awaye to escape, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.4.4	Ye came to Bethell for to worcke vngraciousnes, and haue increased your sinnes at Galgal: ye brought your sacrifyces in the mornynge, and youre tythes vnto the thirde daye.
Amos.4.5	Ye made a thankofferynge of leuen, ye promysed frewill offeringes, and proclamed them. Soch lust had ye, O ye children of Israel, sayeth the Lord God.
Amos.4.6	Therfore haue I geuen you ydle teeth in all youre cyties, and scarsnesse of bred in all your palaces: yet will ye not turne vnto me, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.4.7	When there were but thre monethes vnto the haruest, I withelde the rayne from you: ye I rayned vpon one cytie: and not vpon another, one pece of grounde was moystured wt rayne, and the grounde that I rayned not vpon, was drye.
Amos.4.8	Wherfore two, yee, thre cyties came vnto one, to drincke water: but they were not satisfyed, yet will ye not turne vnto me, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.4.9	I haue smytten you with drouth Ꟶ blastinge: and loke howe many orchardes, vyneyardes, fyggetrees Ꟶ olyuetrees ye had: the caterpyller hath eaten them vp. But yet will ye not turne vnto me, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.4.10	Pestylence haue I sent amonge you, as I dyd in Egypt: your yonge men haue I slayne with the swerde, and caused your horses to be taken captyue: I made the stinckynge sauour of youre tentes to come vp into youre nostrels. Yet will ye not turne vnto me, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.4.11	Some of you haue I ouerthrowen, as I ouerthrewe Sodome and Gomorre: so that ye were as a bronde plucte out of the fyre. Yet wyll ye not turne vnto me, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.4.12	Therfore, thus will I handle the agayne, O Israel, ye euen thus will I handle the. Make the ready then to mete thy God, O Israel.
Amos.4.13	For lo, he maketh the mountaynes, he ordeyneth the wynde, he sheweth man what he is aboute to do: he maketh the mornynge and the darckenes, he treadeth vpon the hye places of the earth; the Lorde God of hostes is his name.
Amos.5.1	Heare thys worde, O ye house of Israel, Ꟶ why? I must make thys mone for you.
Amos.5.2	The vyrgyn Israel shall fall, Ꟶ neuer ryse vp agayne: she shalbe cast downe vpon her awne grounde, and no man shall helpe her vp.
Amos.5.3	For thus sayeth the Lorde God: where as there dwelt a .M. in one cytie, there shalbe left scarce an hundred therin: Ꟶ where there dwelt an .C. there, shall scarce ten be left in the house of Israel.
Amos.5.4	Neuertheles, thus sayth the Lorde vnto the house of Israell: Seke after me, and ye shall lyue,
Amos.5.5	but seke not after Bethel. Come not at Gilgal, and go not to Bersaba: for Gilgal shalbe caryed awaye captyue, and Bethel shall come to naught.
Amos.5.6	Seke the Lorde, that ye maye lyue: lest the house of Ioseph be brent with fyre and consumed Ꟶ lest there be none to quenche Bethell.
Amos.5.7	Ye turne the lawe to wormwod, Ꟶ cast downe ryghteousnes vnto the grounde.
Amos.5.8	Ye forsake the Lord that maketh the .vij. starres Ꟶ the Orions, that turneth the nyght into daye, and of the daye he maketh darcknesse. He calleth the waters of the see, and poureth them out vpon the playne grounde: the Lorde is hys name.
Amos.5.9	He rayseth destruccyon vpon the myghtye people, Ꟶ bringeth downe the stronge holde.
Amos.5.10	But they owe him euell will, that reproueth them openly: and who so telleth them the playne trueth, they abhorre hym.
Amos.5.11	For so moche then as ye oppresse the poore, and robbe him of his best sustenaunce: therfore, where as ye haue buylded houses of square stone, ye shall not dwell in them. Maruelous pleasaunt vyneyardes shall ye plante, but the wyne of them shall ye not drincke: Ꟶ why?
Amos.5.12	as for the multitude of youre wyckednesses and youre stoute synnes, I knowe them ryght well. Enemyes are ye of the ryghteous, ye take rewardes, ye oppresse the poore in iudgement.
Amos.5.13	Therfore, the wyse must nowe be fayne to holde his tunge, so wycked a tyme is it.
Amos.5.14	Seke after the thinge that is good, Ꟶ not euell, so shall ye lyue: yee, the Lorde God of hoostes shalbe with you, accordinge to your awne desyre.
Amos.5.15	Hate the euell, and loue the good: set vp ryght agayne in the porte: and (no doute) the Lorde God of Hoostes shalbe mercyfull vnto the remnaunt of Ioseph.
Amos.5.16	If no (sayeth the Lorde God, the God of hostes) there shall be mournynge in all stretes, yee, they shall saye in euery strete: alas, alas. They shall call the housbandman to lamentacyon, and soch as can mourne to mournynge.
Amos.5.17	In all vyneyardes there shall be heuynesse, for I will come amonge you, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.5.18	Wo be vnto them that desyre the daye of the Lorde. Wherfore wolde ye haue it? As for the daye of the Lorde, it shalbe darcke and not cleare.
Amos.5.19	Yee, lyke as when a man runneth from a lyon, and a Beer meteth with him: or when he commeth into the house, Ꟶ leaneth his hande vpon the wall, a serpent byteth him.
Amos.5.20	Shall not the daye of the Lorde be darcke, Ꟶ not cleare? shall it not be cloudy, Ꟶ no shyne in it?
Amos.5.21	I hate and abhorre your holy dayes, Ꟶ where as ye cense me when ye come together, I wyll not accepte it.
Amos.5.22	And though ye offre me brent offrynges and meat offrynges, yet haue I no pleasure therin. As for your fat thanckofferynges. I wyll not loke vpon them:
Amos.5.23	Awaye with that noyse of thy songes, I will not heare thy playes of musyck:
Amos.5.24	but se that equytie flowe as the water, and ryghteousnesse as a myghtye streame.
Amos.5.25	O ye house of Israel, gaue ye me offrynges and sacrifyces those fourty yeares longe in the wyldernes?
Amos.5.26	yet haue ye set vp tabernacles to your Moloch, and ymages of your Idols, yee, and the starre of your God Rempha, fygures which ye made to worshyppe them.
Amos.5.27	Therfore wyll I cause you to be caryed awaye beyonde Damascus, sayeth the Lord, whose name is the God of Hostes.
Amos.6.1	O wo be to the proude welthy in Syon to soch as thinke them so sure vpon the mount of Samaria? whych holde them selues for the best of the worlde, and rule the house of Israel, euen as they lyst.
Amos.6.2	Go vnto Calne, and se: and from thence get you to Hemath the great cytie, Ꟶ so go downe to Gath of the Philistines: be they better at ease then these kyngdomes, or the border of their lande wyder then yours?
Amos.6.3	Ye are taken out for the euell daye, euen ye that syt in the stole of wylfulnesse.
Amos.6.4	Ye that lye vpon beddes of Yuery, and vse youre wantonnesse vpon your couches: ye that eate the best lambes of the flocke, Ꟶ the fattest calues of the droaue:
Amos.6.5	ye that synge to the lute, and in playenge of instrumentes compare youre selues vnto Dauid:
Amos.6.6	ye that dryncke wyne out of goblettes, and anoynte youre selues with the best oyle, but no man is sory for Iosephs hurte.
Amos.6.7	Therfore, nowe shall ye be the fyrst of them, that shall be led awaye captiue, and the lusty chere of the wylfull shall come to an ende.
Amos.6.8	The Lorde God hath sworne euen by him selfe (sayeth the Lorde God of Hostes) I hate the pryde of Iacob, and I abhorre his palaces: and I will geue ouer the cytie, with all that is therin:
Amos.6.9	so that though there remayne ten men in one house, they shall dye.
Amos.6.10	So their nexte kynsfolekes and the deed buriers shall take them, and cary awaye theyr bones, and saye vnto him, that is in the ynnermer house: is there yet eny mo by the? And he shall answere: they are all gone, holde thy tunge (shall he saye) for they wolde not remembre the name of the Lorde.
Amos.6.11	Beholde, the Lorde is mynded to smyte the greate houses, so that they shall decaye: and the lytle houses, that they shall cleue a sunder.
Amos.6.12	Who can runne wt horses, or plowe with oxen vpon the harde rockes of stone? For why ye haue turned true iudgement into bytternesse Ꟶ the frute of ryghteousnesse into wormwod:
Amos.6.13	Yee, euen ye, that reioyse in vayne thinges: ye that saye: haue not we optayned hornes in oure awne strength?
Amos.6.14	Wel, take hede, O ye house of Israel, sayeth the Lorde God of hoostes: I will bringe a people vpon you, whych shall trouble you, from the waye that goeth towarde Hemath, vnto the broke in the medowe.
Amos.7.1	The Lorde God shewed me soch a vysyon: beholde, there stode one that made greshoppers, euen when the corne was shotynge forth, after the king had clypt his shepe.
Amos.7.2	Now when they vndertoke to eate vp all the grene thinges in the lande, I sayde: O Lord God, be mercyfull, I beseche the: who shulde els helpe vp Iacob that is brought so lowe?
Amos.7.3	So the Lorde was gracious therin, and the Lord sayde: well, it shall not be.
Amos.7.4	Agayne, the Lord shewed me thys visyon: beholde, the Lorde God called the fyre to punysh wythall, and it deuoured the great depe: yee, it consumed a parte all redy.
Amos.7.5	Then sayde I: O Lorde God, holde thyne hande: for who shulde els helpe vp Iacob that is brought so lowe?
Amos.7.6	So the Lord was mercyfull therin, and the Lorde God sayd: wel, it shall not be.
Amos.7.7	Moreouer, he shewed me thys vysyon: beholde, the Lord stode vpon a plastered wall and a masons trowel in his hande.
Amos.7.8	And the Lord sayd vnto me: Amos, what seest thou I answered: a masons trowell. Then sayde the Lorde: beholde, I wyll laye the trowell amonge my people of Israel, Ꟶ wyll nomore ouer se them,
Amos.7.9	but the hye hylchapels of Isaac must be layed waste, and the churches of Israell made desolate, and as for the house of Ieroboam, I wyll stande vp agaynst it with the swerde.
Amos.7.10	Upon thys sent Amasyah the prest to Bethel vnto Ieroboam the kynge of Israel, sayenge. Amos maketh the house of Israel to rebel agaynst the, the lande can not awaye wyth hys wordes.
Amos.7.11	For Amos sayeth, Ieroboam shall dye wyth the swerde, and Israell shall be led awaye captiue out of theyr awne lande.
Amos.7.12	And Amasiah sayde vnto Amos, Gett the hence (thou that canst se so well) and fle into the lande of Iuda: get the there thy lyuinge, and prophecy there:
Amos.7.13	and prophecy nomore at Bethell, for it is the kynges chapell, and the kynges courte.
Amos.7.14	Amos answered, and sayde to Amasiah: As for me I am nether prophet, ner prophetes sonne: but a keper of catell. Now as I was breakynge downe molberies, Ꟶ going after the catell,
Amos.7.15	the Lorde toke me, and sayd vnto me: Go thy waye, and prophecy vnto my people of Israel.
Amos.7.16	And therfore, heare thou nowe the worde of the Lorde: Thou sayest: prophecy not agaynst Israel, and speake nothynge agaynst the house of Isaac.
Amos.7.17	wherfore, thus sayeth the Lord: Thy wyfe shalbe defyled in the cytie, thy sonnes and daughters shall be slayne with the swearde, Ꟶ thy lande shalbe measured out wyth the line. Thou thy selfe shalt dye in an vnclene lande, Ꟶ Israel shalbe dryuen out of his awne contre.
Amos.8.1	The Lorde God: shewed me thys vysyon: and beholde, there was a maunde wt sommer frute.
Amos.8.2	And he sayde: Amos, what seyst thou? I answered: a maunde wt sommer frute. Then sayde the Lorde vnto me: the ende commeth vpon my people of Israel, I wyll nomore ouerse them.
Amos.8.3	In that daye shall the songes of the temple be turned into sorowe, saieth the Lord God, many deed bodyes shall lye in euery place, and be cast forth secretly.
Amos.8.4	Heare thys, O ye that oppresse the poore, and destroye the nedy in the lande, saying:
Amos.8.5	When will the new moneth be gone, that we maye sell vytayle, Ꟶ the Sabboth, that we maye haue scarcenesse of corne: to make the bushel lesse, and the Sycle greater?
Amos.8.6	We shall set vp false wayghtes, that we maye get the pore vuder vs wyth theyr money, and the nedy also for shoes: yee, let vs sell the chaffe for corne.
Amos.8.7	The Lord hath sworne agaynst the pryde of Iacob: these workes of theyrs wyll I neuer forget.
Amos.8.8	Shall not the lande tremble, and all they that dwell therin, mourne for this? Shall not theyr destruccyon come vpon them lyke a water streame, and flowe ouer them as the floude of Egypte?
Amos.8.9	At the same tyme (sayeth the Lord God) I shall cause the Sunne to go downe at none, and the lande to be darcke in the cleare daye.
Amos.8.10	Your hye feastes wyll I turne to sorowe, Ꟶ youre songes to mournynge: I will bringe sack cloth vpon all backes, and baldnes vpon euery head: yee, soch a mournynge wyll I sende them. as is made vpon an only begotten sonne, and they shall haue a myserable ende.
Amos.8.11	Beholde, the tyme commeth (sayeth the Lorde God) that I shall sende an hunger into the earth: not the hunger of bred, ner the thyrst of water: but an hunger so heare the worde of the Lorde:
Amos.8.12	so that they shall go from the one see to the other, yee, from the north vnto the east, runnynge aboute to seke the worde of the Lorde, Ꟶ shall not fynde it
Amos.8.13	In that tyme, shall the fayre virgins Ꟶ the yonge men perysh for thyrst,
Amos.8.14	yee, euen they that sweare in the execrable calfe of Samarya, Ꟶ saye: as truly as thy God lyueth at Dan, and as truly as thy God lyueth at Bersaba. These shall fall, and neuer ryse vp agayne.
Amos.9.1	I sawe the Lorde standynge vpon the aulter, Ꟶ he sayde: smyte the dore cheke, that the postes maye shake wythall. For theyr couetousnesse shall fall vpon all theyr heades, Ꟶ theyr posterite shalbe slayne with the swerde. They shall not fle awaye, there shall not one of them escape, ner be delyuered.
Amos.9.2	Though they were buryed in the hell, my hande shall fetch them from thence: though they clyme vp to heauen, yet shall I cast them downe:
Amos.9.3	though they hyde them selues vpon the toppe of Carmel, yet shall I seke them out, and brynge them from thence: though they crepe downe fro my syght into the depe of the see, I shall commaunde the serpente, euen there to byte them.
Amos.9.4	If they goo awaye before theyr enemyes into captiuite, then shall I commaunde the swerde, there to slaye them. Thus wyll I sett myne eyes vpon them, for theyr harme and not for theyr wealth.
Amos.9.5	For when the Lorde God of hoostes toucheth a lande, it consumeth awaye, and all they that dwell therin, must nedes mourne: And why? theyr destruccyon shall aryse as euery streame Ꟶ runne ouer them, as the floude in Egypte.
Amos.9.6	He that hath hys dwellynge in heauen, Ꟶ groundeth hys tabernacle in the earth: He that calleth the waters as the see, Ꟶ poureth them out vpon the playne grounde: his name is the Lorde.
Amos.9.7	O ye chyldren of Israel, are ye not vnto me, euen as the Moryans, sayeth the Lorde: haue not I brought Israel out of the lande of Egypte, The Philistynes from Capthor, and the Syrians from Cyr?
Amos.9.8	Beholde, the eyes of the Lorde are vpon the realme that synneth, to rote it clene out of the earth: Neuertheles, I will not vtterly destroye the house of Iacob, sayeth the Lorde.
Amos.9.9	For lo this I promyse: though I syfte the house of Israel amonge all nacyons (lyke as they vse to syfte in a syue) yet shall not the smallest grauell stone fall vpon the earth:
Amos.9.10	But all the wicked doers of my people, that saye: Tush, the plage is not so nye, to come so hastely vpon vs: those shall perysh wyth the swerde.
Amos.9.11	At that tyme will I buylde agayne the tabernacle of Dauid, that is fallen downe, and hedge vp his gappes: and loke what ys broken, I shal repayre it: yee, I shall buylde it agayne, as it was afore tyme
Amos.9.12	that they maye possesse the remnaunt of Edom, yee, and all soch people as call vpon my name wyth them, sayeth the Lorde, whych doth these thynges.
Amos.9.13	Beholde, the tyme commeth (sayeth the Lorde) that the plowman shall ouer take the mower, Ꟶ treader of grapes, hym that soweth sede. The mountaynes shall droppe swete wyne, and the hylles shall be frutefull
Amos.9.14	Ꟶ I wyll turne the captiuyte of my people of Israell: they shal repayre the waste cyties, and haue them in possession: they shall plante vyneyardes, and dryncke the wyne therof they shall make gardens, Ꟶ enioye the frutes of them.
Amos.9.15	And I wyll plante them vpon theyr awne grounde, so that I will neuer rote them out agayne from theyr lande whych I haue geuen them sayeth the Lorde thy God.
Amos.0.0	¶ The ende of the Prophecye of Amos.
