Jonah.0.0	¶ The boke of the Prophete Ionas.
Jonah.1.1	The worde of the Lorde came vnto Ionas the sonne of Amythay saying:
Jonah.1.2	Aryse, Ꟶ get the to Niniue that greate cyte: and preache vnto them, how that theyr wyckednes is come vp before me.
Jonah.1.3	And Ionas made him ready to fle vnto Tharsis from the presence of the Lorde, and gat hym downe to Ioppa: where he founde a shyp ready for to go vnto Tharsis. So he payde hys fare, and wente aborde, that he myght go with them vnto Tharsis, from the presence of the Lorde.
Jonah.1.4	But the Lorde hurled a greate wynde into the see, and there was a myghtye tempest in the see: so that the shyppe was in ieoperdy of goynge in peces.
Jonah.1.5	Then the maryners were afrayde, and cryed euery man vnto his God: and the goodes that were in the shyppe, they cast into the see, to lyghten it of them. But Ionas gatt hym vnder the hatches, where he layed him downe Ꟶ slombred.
Jonah.1.6	So the master of the shyppe came to him and sayde vnto him: why slomberest thou? Up, call vpon thy God: yf God (happely) wyll thynke vpon vs, that we perysh not.
Jonah.1.7	And they sayde one to another: come, let vs cast lottes: that we maye knowe, for whose cause we are thus troubled. And so they cast lottes, and the lot fell vpon Ionas.
Jonah.1.8	Then sayd they vnto him: tel vs, for whose cause are we thus troubled? what is thyne occupacyon? whence commest thou? what countre man art thou, and of what nacion?
Jonah.1.9	He answered them: I am an Ebrue, and I feare the Lorde God of heauen, whych made both the see, Ꟶ drye lande.
Jonah.1.10	Then were the men exceadyngly afrayed Ꟶ sayde vnto hym: why dydest thou so? (for they knewe, that he was fled from the presence of the Lorde, because he had tolde them)
Jonah.1.11	Ꟶ sayd moreouer vnto him: What shall we do vnto the, that the see maye ceasse from troublynge vs? (for the see wrought and was troublous)
Jonah.1.12	he answered them: Take me, and cast me into the see, so shall it lett you be in rest: for I wote, it is for my sake, that this great tempeste is come vpon you.
Jonah.1.13	Neuerthelesse, the men assayed wyth rowynge, to brynge the shyppe to lande: but it wolde not be, because the see wrought so: Ꟶ was so troublous agaynst them.
Jonah.1.14	Wherfore they cryed vnto the Lord, Ꟶ sayde: O Lord let vs not perysh for thys mans death, nether laye thou innocent bloude vnto our charge: for thou, O Lord, hast done, euen as thy pleasure was.
Jonah.1.15	So they toke Ionas, and cast hym into the see, and the see lefte ragynge,
Jonah.1.16	And the men feared the Lorde exceadyngly, doyng sacryfyces and makinge vowes vnto the Lorde.
Jonah.2.2	And Ionas prayed vnto the Lorde hys God, out of the fysshes bely,
Jonah.2.3	and sayd. In my trouble I called vnto the Lorde, and he herde me: out of the bely of hell I cryed, Ꟶ thou herdest my voyce.
Jonah.2.4	Thou haddest cast me downe depe in the myddest of the see, Ꟶ the floude compased me aboute: yee, all thy waues and roules of water went ouer me,
Jonah.2.5	I thought that I had bene cast awaye out of thy syght: but I will yet agayne loke towarde thy holy temple.
Jonah.2.6	The waters compased me, euen to the very soule: the depe laye aboute me, Ꟶ the wedes were wrapte aboute myne head.
Jonah.2.7	I went downe to the botome of the hylles, and was barred in with earth for euer. But thou, O Lorde my God, hast brought vp my lyfe agayne out of corrupcion.
Jonah.2.8	When my soule fainted wythin me, I thought vpon the Lorde: Ꟶ my prayer came in vnto the, euen into thy holy temple.
Jonah.2.9	They that hold of vayne vanyties, wyll forsake his mercy.
Jonah.2.10	But I will do the sacrifyce with the voyce of thankesgeuynge, Ꟶ wyll paye that I haue vowed: for why? saluacyon commeth of the Lord.Ion
Jonah.3.1	Then came the worde of the Lord vnto Ionas agayne, sayenge
Jonah.3.2	vp, and get the to Niniue that great cytie Ꟶ preach vnto them the preachynge which I bade the.
Jonah.3.3	So Ionas arose, Ꟶ wente to Niniue at the Lordes commaundement. Niniue was a greate cyte vnto God, namely, of thre dayes iourney,
Jonah.3.4	And Ionas wente to, Ꟶ entred into the cytie: euen a dayes iourney, Ꟶ cryed, sayenge: There are yet .xl. dayes and then shall Niniue be ouerthrowen.
Jonah.3.5	And the people of Niniue beleued God, and proclaymed fastynge, and arayed them selues in sack cloth, as well the greate as the small of them.
Jonah.3.6	And the tydinges came vnto the kyng of Niniue which arose out of hys seate, and dyd hys apparell of and put on sack cloth, and sate hym downe in asshes.
Jonah.3.7	And it was cryed Ꟶ commaunded in Niniue, by the auctorite of the kynge and hys Lordes, sayenge: se that nether man or beest, oxe or shepe taste ought at all: and that they nether fede ner drinke water:
Jonah.3.8	but put on sack cloth both man Ꟶ beast: and crye myghtely vnto God: yee, se that euery man turne from his euell waye, and from the wyckednesse, that he hath in hande.
Jonah.3.9	Who can tell? God maye turne, Ꟶ repente, and cease from his fearcc wrath, that we perysh not.
Jonah.3.10	And when God sawe theyr workes how they turned from their wicked wayes he repented on the euell, which he sayd he wolde do vnto them, and dyd it not.
Jonah.4.1	Therfore Ionas was sore dyscontent and angrie.
Jonah.4.2	And he prayed vnto the Lorde, and sayde: O Lorde, was not thys my sayinge (I praye the) when I was yet in my countre? therfore I hasted rather to fle vnto Tharsis, for I knowe wel ynough that thou art a mercyfull God, full of compassyon, longe sufferyng, and of great kyndnes and repentest when thou shuldest take punyshment,
Jonah.4.3	And now O Lord, take my lyfe fro me (I beseche the) for I had rather dye then lyue.
Jonah.4.4	Then sayde the Lord: art thou so angrie?
Jonah.4.5	And Ionas gat hym out of the cytie, and satt downe on the east syde therof: and there made hym a booth, and sat vnder it in the shadowe, tyll he myght se, what shulde chaunce vnto the cytie.
Jonah.4.6	And the Lord God prepared a wylde vyne, whych sprange vp ouer Ionas, that he myght haue shadowe aboue his head, to delyuer hym out of his payne. And Ionas was excedynge glad of the wylde vyne.
Jonah.4.7	But vpon the nexte morowe agaynst the spryng of the daye. The Lord ordened a worme, whych smote the wylde vyne, so that it wythered awaye.
Jonah.4.8	And when the Sunne was vp, God prepared a feruent east wynde: Ꟶ the Sunne bett ouer the head of Ionas, that he faynted agayne, Ꟶ wysshed vnto his soule, that he myght dye, and sayd: It is better for me to dye, then to lyue.
Jonah.4.9	And God sayd vnto Ionas: Art thou so angrie for the wylde vyne? And he sayd: yee, very angrie am I, euen vnto the deeth.
Jonah.4.10	And the Lord sayd: thou hast compassion vpon a wylde vyne, wheron thou bestowdest no laboure: ner madest it growe whych sprange vp in one nyght Ꟶ peryshed in another:
Jonah.4.11	And shulde not I then haue compassyon vpon Niniue that greate cytie, wherin there are aboue an .C. Ꟶ .xx. thousand personnes, that knowe not theyr ryght hand from the lefte, besydes moch catell?
