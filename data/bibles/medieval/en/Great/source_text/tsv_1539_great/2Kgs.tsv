2Kgs.0.0	¶ The fourth boke of the kynges, after the Latinistes, which boke, Ꟶ the thyrde together, is but one with the Hebrues.
2Kgs.1.1	And Moab did wickedly agaynst Israel after the deeth of Ahab.
2Kgs.1.2	And Ahazia fell thorowe a graate of hys vpper chambre that he had in Samaria: and whyle he was in his sycknesse, he sent messengers, and sayde vnto them: go and enquyre of Beelzebub the God of Ekron, whether I shall recouer of this my disease.
2Kgs.1.3	But the angell of the Lorde spake to Elia the Thesbyte: Aryse, and go vp agaynst the messengers of the kynge of Samaria Ꟶ saye vnto them: Is there not a God in Israel, that ye go to aske councell at Beelzebub the God of Ekron?
2Kgs.1.4	Wherfore, thus sayth the Lorde: thou shalt not come downe from the bed on which thou art gone vp, but shalt die the death. And Elia departed.
2Kgs.1.5	And whan the messengers turned backe agayne vnto him, he sayde vnto them: why are ye nowe come agayne?
2Kgs.1.6	They answered him: there came a man vp against vs, Ꟶ sayde vnto vs? go Ꟶ turne agayne vnto the kynge that sent you, Ꟶ saye vnto him: Thus sayeth the Lorde. Is there not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Beelzebub the God of Ekron? Therfore thou shalt not come downe from the bed on which thou art gone vp, but shalt dye the death.
2Kgs.1.7	And he sayde vnto them: what maner a man was that which came vp in youre waye, Ꟶ tolde you these wordes?
2Kgs.1.8	And they answered him: it was an hearry man and gyrde with a gyrdle of lether about his loynes. And he sayde: it is Elia the Thesbyte.
2Kgs.1.9	Then the kyng sent vnto him a captayne ouer fyftie, with his fyftie men, which came to him: and beholde, he satt on the toppe of an hyll. And he spake vnto him: Thou man of God, the kyng hath sayd: come downe.
2Kgs.1.10	Elia answered and sayde to the captayne ouer the fyftie: yf I be a man of God, fyre come downe from heauen, and consume the Ꟶ thy fyftie. And there came fyre of God, and consumed him and his fyftie.
2Kgs.1.11	And the kynge went agayne, Ꟶ sent to him another captayne ouer fyftie with his fyftie. And he answered and sayde vnto him. O man of God, thus hath the kyng sayd: make hast, and come downe.
2Kgs.1.12	Elia answered and sayde vnto them: yf I be a man of God, fyre come downe from heauen, and consume the Ꟶ thy fyftie. And there came fyre of God downe from heauen, Ꟶ consumed him and his fyftie. And the kyng went agayne and sent the thirde captayne ouer fyftie wt his fyftie men.
2Kgs.1.13	And the thirde captayne ouer fyftie went vp and came Ꟶ fell on his knees before Elia and be sought him, and sayde vnto him: O man of God, let my lyfe and the lyfe of these fyftie thy seruauntes be preciouse in thy syght.
2Kgs.1.14	Beholde, there came fyre downe from heauen, and burnt vp the two fore captaynes ouer fyftie with their fyfties: therfore let my lyfe nowe be preciouse in thy syght.
2Kgs.1.15	And the Angell of the Lorde sayde vnto Elia: go downe wt him, Ꟶ be not afrayde of him. And he arose, and went downe with him vnto the kyng.
2Kgs.1.16	And he sayde vnto him, thus sayth the Lorde: for as moch as thou hast sent messengers to aske councell at Beelzebub the God of Ekron as though there had bene no God in Israel whose worde thou mightest seke after: therfore thou shalt not come downe of the bedd on which thou art gone vp, but shalt dye the death.
2Kgs.1.17	And so he dyed accordynge to the worde of the Lorde which Elia had spoken. And Iehoram beganne to raygne in his steade, in the seconde yeare of Iehoram the sonne of Iehosaphat kyng of Iuda, because he had no sonne.
2Kgs.1.18	The rest of the wordes that concerne Ahazia, what thynges he dyd, are they not wrytten in the boke of the chronicles of the kynges of Israel?
2Kgs.2.1	And it chaunced, that whan the Lorde wolde take vp Elia in to heauen by a whorle wind, Elia went with Elisa from Gilgal.
2Kgs.2.2	And Elia sayde vnto Elisa tary here I praye the, for the Lorde hath sent me to Bethel. Elisa sayde vnto him: as surely as the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule lyueth, I will not leaue the. And they came downe to Bethel,
2Kgs.2.3	And the chyldren of the Prophetes that were at Bethel, came out to Elisa, Ꟶ sayde vnto him: knowest thou not, howe that the Lorde will take a waye thy master from thy head this daye? He sayde: I knowe it also holde ye youre peace.
2Kgs.2.4	And Elia sayde vnto him. Elisa, tary here I praye the, for the Lorde hath sent me to Iericho. He sayde: as surely as the Lord lyueth and as surely as thy soule lyueth, I will not leaue the, Ꟶ so they came to Iericho.
2Kgs.2.5	And the chyldren of the prophetes that were at Iericho came to Elisa and sayde vnto him: knowest thou not, that the Lord will take a waye thy master from thy head thys daye? He answered: I knowe it also, holde ye your peace.
2Kgs.2.6	And Elia sayde vnto him: tarye I praye the here, for the Lorde hath sent me to Iordan. He sayde: as surely as the Lorde lyueth, and as thy soule lyueth, I will not leaue the. And so they two went togeather.
2Kgs.2.7	And fyftie men of the sonnes of the prophetes came and stode on the other syde afarre of, and they two stode by Iordan.
2Kgs.2.8	And Elia toke his mantell and wrapte it together, Ꟶ smote the waters, and they were deuided, parte the one waye Ꟶ parte the other, so that they two went ouer thorowe drye lande.
2Kgs.2.9	And it fortuned, that as sone as they were ouer, Elia sayd vnto Elisa: aske what I shall do for the, yer I be taken awaye from the. And Elisa sayde: I praye the let thy sprete be dowble vpon me.
2Kgs.2.10	And he sayde: thou hast asked an hard thynge. Neuerthelesse, yf thou se me whan I am taken a waye from the thou shalt haue it so: yf thou do not, it shall not be.
2Kgs.2.11	And it fortuned, that as they went walkyng and talkynge: beholde, there appeared a charet of fyre and horsses of fyre, and parted them both a sondre. And Elia went vp thorowe the whorlewinde into heauen.
2Kgs.2.12	And Elisa, sawe, Ꟶ cryed: O my father, O my father, the charet of Israel and the horsemen therof, and he sawe him nomoare: Ꟶ he toke his awne clothes, Ꟶ rent them in two peces.
2Kgs.2.13	He toke vp also the mantell of Elia that fell from him, Ꟶ went backe agayne Ꟶ stode by Iordans syde,
2Kgs.2.14	Ꟶ toke the mantell of Elia (that fell from him,) and smote the waters and he sayd: where is the Lorde God of Elia, and he him selfe? And when he had smyten the waters, they parted this waye Ꟶ that waye, Ꟶ Elisa went ouer.
2Kgs.2.15	And whan the chyldren of the prophetes which were at Iericho sawe hym from a farre, they sayde: the spryte of Elia doth rest on Elisa, and they came to mete him, and fell to the grounde before him,
2Kgs.2.16	Ꟶ sayde vnto him. Se: there be with thy seruauntes fyftie stronge men let them go Ꟶ seke thy master: happlye the spryte of the Lorde hath taken hym vp, and cast hym vpon some mountayne or in to some valeye. And he sayde. Ye shall sende none.
2Kgs.2.17	And whan they laye vpon him tyll he was ashamed, he sayde. Send. They sent therfore fyftye men, which sought him thre dayes and thre nyghtes, but founde him not.
2Kgs.2.18	And whan they came agayne to him, which taryed at Iericho, he sayde vnto them: dyd I not saye vnto you, that ye shulde not go?
2Kgs.2.19	And the men of the cytie sayde vnto Elisa beholde, Syr, the dwellynge of this cytie is pleasaunt as thou thy selfe seest: but the water is naught Ꟶ the grounde baren.
2Kgs.2.20	He sayde. Brynge me a new cruse, and put salt therin. And they brought it to him.
2Kgs.2.21	And he went vnto the springe of the waters, and cast the salt in thither, Ꟶ sayde: thus sayth the Lorde. I haue healed this water, ther shall not come henceforthe ether deeth or barennesse.
2Kgs.2.22	So the waters were healed vnto this daye, accordinge to the sayinge of Eliseus, which he spake.
2Kgs.2.23	And he went vp from thence vnto Bethel. And as he was goinge vp the waye, there came lytle chyldren out of the cytie, Ꟶ mocked him, Ꟶ sayd vnto him. Go vp thou bald heed, go vp thou bald heed.
2Kgs.2.24	And he turned backe, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lorde. And there came two she Beares out of that woodd Ꟶ tare .xlii. chyldren of them.
2Kgs.2.25	And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he turned agayne to Samaria.
2Kgs.3.1	Iehoram the sonne of Ahab beganne to raygne vpon Israel in Samaria the .xviij. yere of Iehosaphat kynge of Iuda, and raygned twelue yeres.
2Kgs.3.2	And he wrought euell in the syght of the Lorde: but not lyke his father and lyke his mother, for he put a waye the ymages of Baal, that his father had made.
2Kgs.3.3	Neuerthelesse, he cleaued vnto the synnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat (which made Israel to synne) and departed not ther from.
2Kgs.3.4	And Mesa kynge of Moab was a Lorde of shepe, and rendered vnto the kynge of Israel an hundred thousande lambes Ꟶ an hundred thousande rammes with the wolle.
2Kgs.3.5	But whan Ahab was deed, it fortuned, that the kynge of Moab rebelled agaynst the kynge of Israel.
2Kgs.3.6	And kynge Iehoram went out of Samaria the same ceason, and nombred all Israell,
2Kgs.3.7	Ꟶ went, Ꟶ sent to Iehosaphat the kynge of Iuda, sayinge: the kynge of Moab hath offended agaynst me, wilt thou come wt me agaynst Moab to battell? He answered: I wyll come vp, for as I am, so art thou and as my people be, so are thy people, Ꟶ thy horses as myne.
2Kgs.3.8	And he sayde. What waye shall we go vp? And he answered. The waye thorowe the wildernesse of Edom.
2Kgs.3.9	And so the kynge of Israel toke his iourneye, and the kynge of Iuda, Ꟶ the kynge of Edom. And when they had compassed the waye seuen dayes, they had no water for the hoost and for the cattell that folowed them.
2Kgs.3.10	And the kynge of Israel sayde. Alas, the Lorde hath called these thre kynges together, to delyuer them ouer into the hande of Moab.
2Kgs.3.11	But Iehosaphat sayde: is there not here a prophet of the Lorde, that we maye enquyre of the Lorde by him? And one of the kynge of Israels seruauntes answered and sayde: here is Elisa the sonne of Saphat, which powred water on the handes of Elia.
2Kgs.3.12	And Iehosaphat sayde Is not the worde of the Lorde wt hym? And so the kynge of Israel, Ꟶ Iehosaphat and the kynge of Edom went downe to him.
2Kgs.3.13	And Elisa sayde vnto the kynge of Israel. what haue I to do with the? Get the, to the prophetes of thy father, and to the prophetes of thy mother. And the kynge of Israel sayde vnto him. Oh naye, For the Lorde hath called these thre kynges together to delyuer them into the hande of Moab.
2Kgs.3.14	And Elisa sayde: as sure as the Lord of Hostes lyueth (in whose syght I stand) and it were not that I regarde the presence of Iehosaphat the kynge of Iuda, I wolde not loke towarde the, nor yet se the.
2Kgs.3.15	But nowe bringe me a mynstrell. And whan the mynstrell played, the hande of the Lorde came vpon him.
2Kgs.3.16	And he sayde. Thus sayeth the Lorde. Make this playne grounde full of diches.
2Kgs.3.17	For thus sayth the Lorde: ye shall se nether wynde nor rayne, Ꟶ yet the broke shalbe fylled wt water, that ye maye dryncke, both ye, and youre beastes, and youre catell.
2Kgs.3.18	And this is yet but a small thynge in the syght of the Lorde, for asmoch as he will geue ouer the Moabites also into youre handes.
2Kgs.3.19	And ye shall smyte euery stronge towne, and euery goodlye cytie, and shall fell euery pleasaunt tree, and stoppe euery well of water, and marre euery good platte of grounde with stones.
2Kgs.3.20	And in the morninge, whan the meateofferynge was offred, it fortuned, that there came water by the waye from Edom, and the contreye was fylled with water.
2Kgs.3.21	And when all the Moabites hearde that the kynges were come vp to fyght agaynst them, they gathered all to geather, from the youngest that was able to put on harnesse and so vpwarde, and stode in the border of the lande.
2Kgs.3.22	And they were vp early in the morninge and the sonne shone vpon the water, that the Moabites sawe the water a farre of as red as bloude,
2Kgs.3.23	and they sayde. This is the bloude of slaughter: the kynges are slayne and one hath smytten another. Nowe therfore Moab gett the to the spoyle.
2Kgs.3.24	And when they came to the Hoste of Israel, the Israelytes stode vp and smote the Moabites, so that they fledd before them, but they folowed vpon them, Ꟶ smote Moab.
2Kgs.3.25	And they ouerthrewe the cyties, Ꟶ on euery good parcell of lande, cast euery man his stone, and fylled it, and they stopte all the welles of waters, and felde all the good trees. Onely in the cytie of brick left they the stones therof: howbeit they went aboute it with slynges, and smote it.
2Kgs.3.26	And when the kynge of Moab sawe, that the battell was sore agaynst him, he toke wt him seuen hundred men that drew the swerde to haue gone thorowe, euen vnto the kynge of Edom: but they coulde not.
2Kgs.3.27	And then he toke his eldest sonne (that shulde haue raygned in his steade) Ꟶ offered him for a burnt offering vpon the wall. And ther was great indignacyon agaynst Israel, and they departed from him, and returned to their awne lande.
2Kgs.4.1	And there cryed a certen woman of the wyues of the prophetes vnto Elisa, sayinge: thy seruaunt my husbande is deed, and thou knowest, that thy seruaunt dyd feare the Lorde. And the creditor is come, to fett my two sonnes, to be his bondemen.
2Kgs.4.2	Elisa sayde vnto her. Tell me what shall I do for the? What hast thou in thyne house? She sayde, thyne handmayde hath nothinge at all in the house, saue a pitcher with oyle.
2Kgs.4.3	He sayde vnto her: Go Ꟶ borowe vessell for the, of them that are without euen of all thy neyboures, emptie vesselles and that not a fewe.
2Kgs.4.4	And when thou art come in, thou shalt shutt the dore after the and after thy sonnes, and powre out into all those vesselles, and sett asyde that which is full.
2Kgs.4.5	And so the woman went from him, and shutt the dore after her and after her sonnes. And they brought to her, Ꟶ she powred out.
2Kgs.4.6	And it came to passe, that when the vesselles were full, she sayde vnto her sonne: brynge me yet a vessell. And he sayde vnto her: I haue no mo. And the oyle ceased.
2Kgs.4.7	Then she came, and tolde the man of God. And he sayde: go Ꟶ sell the oyle, Ꟶ paye them that thou art in dett vnto, but lyue thou Ꟶ thy chyldren of the rest.
2Kgs.4.8	And it fell on a daye, that Elisa came to Sunem, where was a great woman, that toke him in, for to eate breed. And so it came to passe, that from that tyme forth (as ofte as he came that waye) he turned in thither to eate breed.
2Kgs.4.9	And she sayde vnto her husbande. Beholde, I perceaue, that this is a holy man of God, that commeth so oft by oure place.
2Kgs.4.10	Lett vs make him a chambre (I praye the) with walles, Ꟶ let vs set him there a beed, Ꟶ a table, a stole Ꟶ a candelsticke: that he maye turne in thyther when he commeth to vs.
2Kgs.4.11	And it fortuned on a daye, that he came thither Ꟶ turned into the chambre, Ꟶ laye there in,
2Kgs.4.12	and sayde to Gehezi his seruaunt: call this Sunamite. And whan he called her, she presented hyr selfe before hym.
2Kgs.4.13	And agayne he sayde vnto him: Tell her. Beholde, thou hast bene carefull for vs, and hast made all thys prouision. What shall we nowe do for the? Woldest thou be spoken for to the kynge or to the captayne of the Hoste? She answered I dwell amonge myne awne people.
2Kgs.4.14	And he sayde agayne, what is to be done for her? Ge hezi answered. Uerely she hath no chylde, Ꟶ her husbande is olde.
2Kgs.4.15	And he sayde: call her. And whan he had called her, she stode in the dore.
2Kgs.4.16	And he sayde by soch a tyme, and as sone as the frute can liue, thou shalt embrace a sonne. And she sayde: Oh naye my Lorde, thou man of God, do not lye vnto thine handmayd.
2Kgs.4.17	And the wyfe conceaued, and bare a sonne that same ceason that Eliseus had sayde vnto her as sone as the frute coulde haue lyfe.
2Kgs.4.18	And when the chylde was growne, it fell on a daye, that he went out to his father, and to the reapers.
2Kgs.4.19	And he sayde vnto hys father, my heed, my heed. And he sayd to a lad. Carye him to his mother.
2Kgs.4.20	And whan he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sate on her knees tyll none, and then dyed.
2Kgs.4.21	And she went vp, and layde him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the dore about him, and went out,
2Kgs.4.22	and called vnto her husbande and sayde: sende with me (I praye the) one of the younge men Ꟶ one of the Asses, For I wyll runne to the man of God, and come agayne.
2Kgs.4.23	And he sayde: wherfore wylt thou go to him seinge that to daye is nether newe mone nor Saboth daye. She answered: For health.
2Kgs.4.24	Then she sadelled an Asse, Ꟶ sayde to hir seruaunt: leade a waye the asse, and make her not to go slowly (because I ryde vpon her) but whan I byd the.
2Kgs.4.25	And so she went Ꟶ came vnto the man of God, to mount Carmel. And it fortuned: that when the man of God sawe her farre of, he sayde to Gehezi his seruaunt. Beholde, yonder is the Sunamite.
2Kgs.4.26	Runne therfore to mete her, and saye vnto her: Is all well with the and with thy husbande, Ꟶ with the ladd? And she answered. All is well.
2Kgs.4.27	And when she came to the man of God vp to the hyll, she caught him by the fete. But Gehezi went to her, to thrust her awaye. And the man of God sayde: let her alone, for her soule is vexed within her, and the Lorde hath hidd it from me, and hath not tolde it me.
2Kgs.4.28	Then she sayde: dyd I desyre a sonne of my Lorde? dyd I not require the, that thou shuldest not disceaue me?
2Kgs.4.29	Then he sayde to Gehezi: gyrde vp thy loynes, and take my staffe in thyne hande, and go thy waye. If thou mete anye man salute him not. And yf any salute the, answere him not agayne. And laye my staffe vpon the face of the chylde.
2Kgs.4.30	And the mother of the chylde sayde: as sure as the Lorde lyueth, Ꟶ as thy soule liueth. I will not leaue the. And he arose and folowed her.
2Kgs.4.31	Gehezi went before them, Ꟶ layed the staffe vpon the face of the chylde. But there was nether voyce nor any feling. Wherfore he went agayne to mete him, and tolde him, sayinge: the childe is not awaked.
2Kgs.4.32	And when Elisa was come into the house: Beholde, the chylde was deed and layde vpon his bed.
2Kgs.4.33	He went in therfore, Ꟶ shut the dore to the ladd and him, and prayed vnto the Lorde.
2Kgs.4.34	And went vp Ꟶ laye vpon the ladd, Ꟶ put his mouth on his mouth, Ꟶ his eyes vpon his eyes, Ꟶ his handes vpon his handes, and whan he so laye vpon the chylde, the flesshe of the chylde waxed warme.
2Kgs.4.35	And he went agayne, Ꟶ walked once vp and downe in the house, and then went vp, and layed him selfe vpon him agayne. And then the chylde gasped seuen times and opened his eyes.
2Kgs.4.36	And he called Gehezi, Ꟶ sayde: Call for this Sunamite. So he called her: which when she was come in vnto him, he sayde vnto her: take thy sonne.
2Kgs.4.37	Therfore she went in, and fell at his fete, Ꟶ bowed her selfe to the grounde, and toke vp her sonne, and went out.
2Kgs.4.38	Elisa came agayne to Gilgal, and there was a derth in the lande, and the chyldren of the prophetes dwelt with him. And he sayde vnto his seruaunt. Set a great pot on the fyre, and make pottage for the chyldren of the prophetes.
2Kgs.4.39	And one went out into the felde, to gather herbes, Ꟶ founde a wilde vyne, and gathered therof wylde Coloquyntydas his lappe full, Ꟶ came, Ꟶ shred them into the potte of potage: for they knewe it not.
2Kgs.4.40	So they powred out for the men to eate. And it fortuned, that when they tasted of the pottage, they cryed out, and sayde: O thou man of God there is deeth in the pot: and they coulde not eate therof.
2Kgs.4.41	But he sayde: brynge meale. And he cast it into the pot, Ꟶ sayde: fyll for the people, that they maye eate, and there was no more harme in the pot.
2Kgs.4.42	There came a man from Baal Salisa, Ꟶ brought the man of God bread of the fyrst frutes, euen .xx. loafes of barlye, and newe corne which was yet in his bagges. And he sayde: Geue vnto the people, that they maye eate.
2Kgs.4.43	And his mynister answered: why, shall I set this before an hundred men? He sayde agayne: geue it vnto the people that they maye eate. For thus sayth the Lorde they shall eate, and ther shalbe left ouer.
2Kgs.4.44	And so he sett it before them, Ꟶ they dyd eate, and left ouer, accordynge to the worde of the Lorde.
2Kgs.5.1	Naaman, captayne of the Hoste of the kynge of Siria, was a greate man, and honorable in the syght of his master: because that by him the Lorde had geuen health vnto Siria. He was also a myghtie man, and experte in warre, but he was a leper.
2Kgs.5.2	And the Syrians had gone out by companies, Ꟶ had brought out of the contreye of Israel a lytle mayde, Ꟶ she was with Naamans wyfe.
2Kgs.5.3	And she sayde vnto her ladye: I wold to God my Lorde were with the prophet that is in Samaria: for he wolde delyuer him of his leprosie.
2Kgs.5.4	And he went in, and tolde his Lorde, sayinge: thus and thus sayde the mayde, that is of the lande of Israel.
2Kgs.5.5	And the kynge of Syria sayde: Come and entre in and I wyll sende a letter vnto the kynge of Israel. And he came, and toke with him ten talentes of syluer, and .vj. thousande peces of golde, Ꟶ ten chaunge of raymentes,
2Kgs.5.6	and brought the letter to the kynge of Israel contaynynge this tenoure: Nowe when this letter is come vnto the: Beholde, I haue therwith sent Naaman my seruaunt to the, that thou mayest rydde him of his leprosie.
2Kgs.5.7	And it fortuned, that when the kynge of Israel had redde the letter, he rent his clothes, and sayde: am I God, that I shulde slaye, Ꟶ make alyue? For he doth sende to me that I shulde delyuer a man from his leprosie. Wherfore consyder (I praye you) and se howe he seketh a quarell agaynst me.
2Kgs.5.8	which when Elisa the man of God had hearde, howe that the kynge of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent to the kynge, sayinge. Wherfore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come nowe to me Ꟶ he shall know, that there is a prophet in Israel.
2Kgs.5.9	And so Naaman came wt his horsses and with his charettes, and stode at the dore of the housse of Elisa.
2Kgs.5.10	And Elisa sent a messenger vnto him, sayinge: go and washe the in Iordan seuen tymes, Ꟶ thy fleshe shall come agayne to the, Ꟶ thou shalt be cleansed.
2Kgs.5.11	But Naaman was wroth, Ꟶ went a waye, Ꟶ sayde. Beholde I thought wt my selfe: he wolde surely come out, and stande Ꟶ call on the name of the Lorde his God, and put his hande on the place that he maye heale the leprosie.
2Kgs.5.12	Are not Abana Ꟶ Pharphar, ryuers of Damasco, better then all the waters of Israel? Yf I washe me also in them, shall I not be clensed? And so he turned him, and departed with displeasure.
2Kgs.5.13	And his seruauntes came, Ꟶ commoned with hym, and sayde: Father, yf the prophete had bydd the do some great thinge, oughtest thou not to haue done it? How moch rather then, whan he sayth to the: wasshe, and be cleane?
2Kgs.5.14	Then went he downe, Ꟶ wasshed him selfe seuen tymes in Iordan, accordynge to the sayinge of the man of God, Ꟶ his flesshe chaunged, like vnto the flesshe of a lytle chylde, Ꟶ he was cleansed.
2Kgs.5.15	And he turned agayne to the man of God, he and all his companie, and stode before him, and sayde: Beholde, I knowe nowe that there is no God in all the worlde, but in Israel. Nowe therfore take a blessinge of thy seruaunt.
2Kgs.5.16	But he sayde: as surely as the Lorde liueth (before whom I stande) I will receaue none. And whan the other wolde haue constrayned hym to receaue it, he wolde not.
2Kgs.5.17	And Naaman sayde: Shall there not be geuen to thy seruaunt as moch of this erthe as two mules maye beare? For thy seruaunt will here forth offer nether burnt sacrifyce nor offeringe vnto any other God, saue vnto the Lorde.
2Kgs.5.18	But herin the Lorde be mercyfull to thy seruaunt, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon, Ꟶ doth worshyppe there, Ꟶ leaneth on my hande, and I also worshyppe in the house of Rimmon. (Whan I do worshyppe I saye) in the house of Rimmon, the Lorde be mercyfull vnto thy seruaunt because of thys thinge.
2Kgs.5.19	Unto whom he sayde: go in peace. And when he was departed from him as it were a furlonge of grounde,
2Kgs.5.20	Gehezi the seruaunt of Elisa the man of God, sayde: beholde, my master hath spared Naaman thys Syrian, that he wolde not receaue of hys hande those thynges that he offered. As surely as the Lorde lyueth, I wyll runne after him, Ꟶ take some what of him.
2Kgs.5.21	And so Gehezi folowed Naaman. And when Naaman sawe him runninge after him, he lyght downe from the charet, to mete him, and sayde: is all well?
2Kgs.5.22	He answered: All is well. Beholde, my master hath sent me, sayinge: se, there be come to me euen nowe from mount Ephraim two yonge men of the chyldren of the prophetes: geue them I praye the, one talent of syluer and two chaunge of garmentes.
2Kgs.5.23	And Naaman sayde: With a good will. Take two talentes: Ꟶ he compelled him to bynde two talentes of syluer in two bagges, with two chaunge of garmentes, and layed them vpon two of his seruauntes, to beare them before him.
2Kgs.5.24	And whan he came in to a secrete place, he toke them from their hande, Ꟶ bestowed it in the house, Ꟶ the men were let go,
2Kgs.5.25	and they departed. But he went in, and stode before his master. And Elisa sayde vnto him: whence commest thou Gehezi? He sayde: thy seruaunt went no whether.
2Kgs.5.26	But he sayde vnto hym: went not myne hert with the, when the man turned agayne from his charet to mete the? Is it nowe a tyme to receaue moneye, to receaue garmentes, olyue trees, vyneyardes, shepe and oxen, men seruauntes Ꟶ mayde seruauntes?
2Kgs.5.27	The leprosye therfore of Naaman shall cleaue vnto the, and vnto thy seed for euer. And he went out from his presence a leper, as whyte as snowe.
2Kgs.6.1	The chyldren of the prophetes sayde vnto Elisa: Beholde, the place where we dwell with the, is to lytle for vs.
2Kgs.6.2	We wyll therfore go vnto Iordane, and take thence euery man a beame, and buylde vs a place, to dwell in. And he answered: goo.
2Kgs.6.3	And one sayde: be content I praye the, and come with thy seruauntes. And he answered: I wyll come,
2Kgs.6.4	and so he went with them. And when they came to Iordan, they cutt downe wood.
2Kgs.6.5	But it fortuned, that as one was fellinge downe of a tre, the axe heed fell into the water. And he cryed, Ꟶ sayde: Alas master, it was lent me.
2Kgs.6.6	And the man of God sayde. Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut downe a stycke, Ꟶ cast it in thither, Ꟶ immediatly the yron dyd swymme.
2Kgs.6.7	Therfore sayde he: take it vp. And he stretched out his hande, and toke it vp.
2Kgs.6.8	But the kynge of Siria warred agaynst Israel, Ꟶ toke councell with his seruauntes, and sayde: In yonder secrete place shalbe my remayninge.
2Kgs.6.9	And the man of God sent vnto the kynge of Israel, sayinge: Beware, that thou go not ouer to soch a place, for there the Sirians are lurkynge.
2Kgs.6.10	Therfore the kynge of Israel sent to the place which the man of God tolde him, and warned him of, and saued him selfe from it, not once nor twyse.
2Kgs.6.11	And the hert of the kynge of Siria was troubled for this thinge, and he called for his seruauntes and sayde vnto them: wyll ye not shewe me, which of oure men to the kynge of Israel?
2Kgs.6.12	And one of his seruauntes sayde: none my Lorde o kynge. But Elisa the prophet, that is in Israel, telleth the kinge of Israel, yea euen, the wordes that thou speakest in thy preuye chambre.
2Kgs.6.13	He sayde: go, Ꟶ spie where he is, that I maye sende and fett him. And one tolde him, sayinge: beholde, he is in Dothan.
2Kgs.6.14	Therfore sent he thither horses and charettes, and a myghtye Hoste. And they came by nyght, Ꟶ compassed the citie about.
2Kgs.6.15	And when the seruaunt of the man of God rose vp early to go out: Beholde, there was an Host round about the towne with horses and charettes. And his seruaunt sayde vnto him: Alas master, what shall we do?
2Kgs.6.16	He answered feare not, for they that be with vs, are moo then they that be wyth them.
2Kgs.6.17	And Elisa prayed and sayde: Lorde (I beseche the) open hys eyes, that he maye se. And the Lorde opened the eyes of the yonge man. And beholde, the mountayne was full of horses, and charettes of fyre rounde aboute Elisa.
2Kgs.6.18	And when they came downe to hym, Elisa prayed vnto the Lorde, and sayde: Smyte thys people (I praye the) with blindnesse. And he smote them with blindnes, accordinge to the desyre of Elysa.
2Kgs.6.19	And Elisa sayde vnto them this is not the waye, nether is this the towne: folowe me, and I wyll bringe you to the man whom ye seke. But he ledd them to Samaria.
2Kgs.6.20	And it fortuned, that when they were come to Samaria, Elisa sayde: Lorde, open their eyes that they maye se. And the Lorde opened their eyes, and they sawe. And beholde, they were in the myddes of Samaria.
2Kgs.6.21	And the kynge of Israel sayde vnto Elisa, when he sawe them: My father, shall I smyte them:
2Kgs.6.22	And he answered: Thou shalt not smyte them. But smyte those that thou hast taken with thyne awne swerde, and wt thyne awne bowe. But rather set bread and water before them, that they maye eate and drincke, and go to their master.
2Kgs.6.23	And he prepared a great refeccyon for them. And when they had eaten and droncke, he sent them a waye and they went to their master. And so the soudyoures of Syria came nomore into the lande of Israel.
2Kgs.6.24	After thys it chaunced, that Benhadad kynge of Siria gathered all his Hoste Ꟶ went vp, and beseged Samaria.
2Kgs.6.25	But there was a greate derth in Samaria: and beholde, they beseged it, vntyll an Asses heed (was solde) for foure skore syluer pens, and the fourth part of a Cab of doues donge for fyue sicles.
2Kgs.6.26	And as the kynge of Israel was goinge vpon the wall, there cryed a woman vnto him sayinge: helpe, my Lorde O kynge.
2Kgs.6.27	He sayd: yf the Lord do not succoure the: wherwith can I helpe the: wt the barne, or wt the wyne presse?
2Kgs.6.28	And the kynge sayde vnto her: what wilt thou? She answered: yonder woman sayde vnto me: brynge thy sonne, that we maye eate him to daye, and we wyll eate myne to morowe.
2Kgs.6.29	And so we dressed my sonne and dyd eate him. And I sayde to her the other daye: brynge thy sonne that we maye eate hym, and she hath hyd her sonne.
2Kgs.6.30	And it came to passe, that when the kynge hearde the wordes of the woman, he rent his clothes, and went vp on the wall. And the people loked: and beholde he had a sack cloth vnder, vpon hys flesshe.
2Kgs.6.31	Then he sayde: God do so Ꟶ so to me, yf the heed of Elisa the sonne of Saphat shall stande on him this daye.
2Kgs.6.32	But Elisa satt in his house and the elders satt by him, Ꟶ the kynge sent a man before him. But yer the messenger came to him, he sayde to the elders haue ye not sene, howe that the sonne of this murtherar hath sent, to take awaye myne heed? be circumspect when the messenger commeth, and shut the dore, and holde him at the dore: is not the sounde of hys masters fete behinde him?
2Kgs.6.33	Whyle he yet talked with them: Beholde the messenger came downe vnto him, Ꟶ sayde beholde, this euell is of the Lorde, Ꟶ what more shall I loke for of the Lorde
2Kgs.7.1	Then Elisa sayde: heare ye the worde of the Lorde: thus sayth the Lorde. to morowe thys tyme shall a bousshell of fyne floure be solde for a Sicle, and two bousshelles of Barley for a Sycle in the gate of Samaria.
2Kgs.7.2	Then a certayne Lorde (on whose hand the kynge leaned) answered the man of God, and sayde: beholde, yf the Lorde wolde make wyndowes in heuen, myghte this sayinge come to passe? He sayde: Beholde, thou shalt se it wt thyne eyes, but shalt not eate therof.
2Kgs.7.3	And there were foure leperous men at the entringe in of the gate. And they sayde one to another, why sytt we here, vntill we dye?
2Kgs.7.4	Yf we saye: we will entre into the citie, beholde: the derth is in the cytie, and we shall dye therin. And yf we sytt styll here, we dye also. Nowe therfore come, and let vs fall vpon the hoste of the Sirians: If they saue oure lyues we shall lyue: Yf they kyll vs, then are we deed.
2Kgs.7.5	And so they arose in the nyght, to go to the hoste of the Sirians. And when they were come to the vttmost parte of the hoste of Siria: beholde, there was no man there.
2Kgs.7.6	For the Lorde had made the hoste of the Sirians to heare a noyse of charettes and a noyse of horsses, Ꟶ the noyse of a great hoste. In so moch that they sayde one to another, lo, the kynge of Israel hath hyred agaynst vs the kynges of the Hethites, and the kynges of the Egypcyans, to come vpon vs.
2Kgs.7.7	Wherfore they arose and fled in the nyght, and left their tentes their horsses, and their Asses, and the felde which they had pytched euen as it was, Ꟶ fled for their lyues.
2Kgs.7.8	And when these lippers came to the edge of the host, they went into a tent, Ꟶ dyd eate, Ꟶ dryncke, Ꟶ caryed thence syluer, Ꟶ gold and rayment, and went and hydd it: came agayne and entred into another tent, and caryed thence also, and went and hidd it.
2Kgs.7.9	Then sayde one to another: We do not well thys daye, for asmoch as it is a daye to bringe good tydinges, Ꟶ we holde oure peace Yf we tarye tyll the daye lyght, some mischeffe wyll come vpon vs. Nowe therfore come, that we maye goo, and tell the kynges housholde.
2Kgs.7.10	And so they came, Ꟶ called vnto the porter of the cytie, and tolde them sayinge: we came to the pauilions of the Syrians: Ꟶ se, there was no man there, nether voyce of man, but horsses and Asses tyed, and the tentes were, euen as they were wont to be.
2Kgs.7.11	And so the man called vnto the porters, Ꟶ they tolde the kynges house within.
2Kgs.7.12	And the kynge arose in the nyght, and sayde vnto his seruauntes. I wyll shewe you nowe, what the Syrians haue done vnto vs. They knewe that we be hungrye, Ꟶ therfore are they gone out of the pauylions, to hyde them selues in the felde, sayinge: Whan they come out of the cytie, we shall catch them alyue, and get into the cytie.
2Kgs.7.13	And one of his seruauntes answered, and sayde. Let men take (I praye you) fyue of the horsses that remayne, and are lefte in the multitude. Beholde they are euen as all the multitude of Israel that are lefte in the cytie: beholde (I saye) they are euen as all the multitude of the Israelytes that are consumed, Ꟶ we wyll sende, Ꟶ se.
2Kgs.7.14	They toke therfore the horsses of two charettes, and the kynge sent after the hoste of the Syrians, sayinge: go, Ꟶ se.
2Kgs.7.15	And they went after them, euen vnto Iordan: and lo, all the waye was full of clothes and vesselles which the Syrians had cast from them in their haste. And the messengers returned, and tolde the kynge.
2Kgs.7.16	And the people went out, Ꟶ spoyled the tentes of the Syrians. And so it came to passe, that a busshel of fyne flowre was sold for a sycle, and two busshelles of barley for a sycle accordynge to the worde of the Lorde.
2Kgs.7.17	And the kynge apoynted the Lorde (on whose hand he leaned) to be at the gate. And the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he dyed, accordynge to the worde of the man of God which he sayde, when the kynge came downe to him.
2Kgs.7.18	And so came the thynge to passe that the man of God had spoken to the kynge, saynge: two busshelles of barley for a sycle, Ꟶ a busshell of fyne floure for another, shalbe to morowe this tyme in the gate of Samaria.
2Kgs.7.19	Wher vnto that Lorde answered the man of God, and sayde. Yee, and yf the Lorde made wyndowes in heauen myght it come to passe? And he sayde: Beholde, thou shalt se it with thyne eyes, Ꟶ shalt not eate therof.
2Kgs.7.20	And euen so chaunced it vnto him: for the people troad vpon him in the gate, and he dyed.
2Kgs.8.1	Then spake Elisa vnto the woman (whose sonne he had restored to lyfe agayne) sayinge: vp and go, thou and thyne house, Ꟶ soiourne wheresoeuer thou canst, for the Lorde hath called for a derth, and the same shall come vpon the land seuen yeres.
2Kgs.8.2	And the woman arose, and dyd after the sayinge of the man of God, and went both she and her houshold, Ꟶ soiourned in the lande of the Philistines seuen yere.
2Kgs.8.3	And at the seuen yeres ende, it fortuned, that the woman came agayne out of the lande of the Philistines, and went out to call vpon the kynge for her house and for her land.
2Kgs.8.4	And the kynge talked with Gehezi the seruaunt of the man of God, sayinge: tell me I praye the all the great deades that Elisa hath done.
2Kgs.8.5	He tolde the kynge, howe he had restored a deed bodye to lyfe agayne: but in the meane tyme the woman (whose sonne he had raysed vp agayne) cryed to the kynge for her house Ꟶ for her lande. And Gehezi sayde: My Lorde O kyng, thys is the woman, and thys is her sonne whom Elisa raysed vp agayne.
2Kgs.8.6	And whan the kynge asked the woman, she tolde hym. And so the kynge delyuered her a chambrelayne, sayinge: restore thou vnto her all that are hers, and all the frutes of the felde, sence the daye that she left the lande, vnto this tyme.
2Kgs.8.7	And Elisa came to Damascon, Ꟶ Benhadad the kynge of Siria was sycke. And one tolde him sayinge. The man of God is come hither.
2Kgs.8.8	And the kynge sayde vnto Hazael: take a present in thine hande, and goo mete the man of God, that thou mayest aske the Lord by him, whether I shall recouer of this disease.
2Kgs.8.9	And so Hazael went to mete him and toke the present with him, and of euery good thinge of Damascon, euen as moch as fourtye Cameles coulde beare, and came Ꟶ presented hym selfe before hym, and sayde: Thy sonne Benhadad kynge of Siria hath sent me to the, sayinge, shall I recouer of this dysease?
2Kgs.8.10	And Elisa sayd vnto him: go Ꟶ saye vnto him: thou shalt recouer, howbeit the Lorde hath shewed me, that he shall surely dye.
2Kgs.8.11	And he loked asyde, and was asshamed, and the man of God wepte.
2Kgs.8.12	And Hazael sayde: why wepeth my Lord? He answered: for I know the euyll thinges that thou shalt do vnto the chyldren of Israel: for their stronge cyties shalt thou sett on fyre, and their younge men shalt thou sley with the swerde Ꟶ shalt dasshe out the braynes of their suckynge chyldren, Ꟶ all to teare their wemen with chylde.
2Kgs.8.13	But Hazael sayde: what is thy seruaunt, a dogge, that I shulde do this great thynge? And Elisa answered: the Lorde hath shewed me, that thou shalt be kynge of Siria.
2Kgs.8.14	And so he departed from Elisa, Ꟶ came to his master, which sayde to him. What sayde Elisa to the? He answered: he tolde me, that thou shuldest recouer.
2Kgs.8.15	And on the morowe it fortuned, that he toke a thicke cloth, and dypt it in water, and spred it on his face, and he dyed, and Hazael raygned in his steade.
2Kgs.8.16	The fyfte yeare of Iehoram the sonne of Ahab kynge of Israel, Iehosaphat beynge also kinge of Iuda, Iehoram the sonne of Iehosaphat kynge of Iuda, beganne to raygne.
2Kgs.8.17	.xxxii. yere olde was he, when he beganne to raygne, and he raygned eyght yere in Ierusalem.
2Kgs.8.18	And he walked in the wayes of the kinges of Israel, as they that were of the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wyfe, and he dyd euell in the syght of the Lorde.
2Kgs.8.19	And the Lorde wolde not destroye Iuda, and that because of Dauid hys seruaunt, as he promysed hym to geue hym all waye a lyght amonge hys chyldren.
2Kgs.8.20	In those dayes Edom dyd wickedly when he was vnder the hande of Iuda. For they made them a kynge of theyr awne.
2Kgs.8.21	So Iehoram went to zair, he and all his charettes with hym. And he rose by nyght, and smote the Edomites, which compassed hym in, with the captaynes of hys charettes, Ꟶ the people fledd into theyr tentes.
2Kgs.8.22	But Edom rebelled, so that he wold not be vnder the hande of Iuda vnto thys daye. And then Lobnah began to be disobedient euen that same tyme.
2Kgs.8.23	The rest of the wordes that concerne Ioram and all that he dyd, are they not wrytten in the boke of the chronicles of the kynges of Iuda?
2Kgs.8.24	And Ioram rested with hys fathers, and was buryed besyde his fathers in the citie of Dauid. And Ahaziahu his sonne raygned in his steade.
2Kgs.8.25	In the .xij. yere of Ioram the sonne of Ahab kynge of Israel, dyd Ahaziahu the sonne of Iehoram kinge of Iuda begynne to raygne.
2Kgs.8.26	Two Ꟶ twentye yere olde was Ahaziahu when he beganne to raygne, and he raygned one yere in Ierusalem, and hys mothers name was Athaliahu the daughter of Omri kynge of Israel.
2Kgs.8.27	But he walked in the waye of the house of Ahab, and dyd euell in the sight of the Lorde, euen as dyd the house of Ahab.
2Kgs.8.28	For he was the sonne in lawe of the house of Ahab. And he went with Ioram the sonne of Ahab to warre agaynst Hazael kynge of Siria, in Ramoth Gilead, Ꟶ the Sirians wounded Ioram.
2Kgs.8.29	And kynge Ioram went back agayne to be healed in Iesrahel of the woundes which the Sirians had geuen hym at Ramoth, when he fought agaynst Hazael king of Siria. And Ahaziahu the sonne of Iehoram kynge of Iuda went downe to se Ioram the sonne of Ahab in Iesrael, because he was sycke there.
2Kgs.9.1	And Elisa the prophete called one of the chyldren of the prophetes, Ꟶ sayd vnto him: gyrde vp thy loynes, and take thys boxe of oyle in thyne hande, and get the to Ramoth in Gilead.
2Kgs.9.2	And when thou commest thyther, loke where is Iehu the sonne of Iehosaphat, the sonne of Nimsi, and go to him, and make him aryse vp from amonge hys brethren, Ꟶ carye hym to a secret chambre.
2Kgs.9.3	Then take the boxe of oyle, and powre it on hys heed, and saye: thus sayth the Lorde: I haue anoynted the to be kynge ouer Israel. And then open the dore, and flee without any taryinge.
2Kgs.9.4	And so the seruaunt of the prophete gat him to Ramoth Gilead:
2Kgs.9.5	and when he came in, beholde, the captaynes of the hoost were syttynge togyther. And he sayde: I haue an errand to the, o captayne. And Iehu sayde: vnto which of all vs? He sayde: to the, o captayne.
2Kgs.9.6	And he arose, and went into the house. And he powred the oyle on hys heed, and sayde vnto hym: thus saythe the Lorde God of Israel: I haue anoynted the to be kinge ouer the people of the Lorde, euen ouer Israel.
2Kgs.9.7	Thou shalt smyte the house of Ahab thy master, that I maye aduenge the bloud of my seruauntes the prophetes, and the bloude of all the seruauntes of the Lorde, of the hande of Iezabel,
2Kgs.9.8	for the whole house of Ahab shalbe destroyed, and I wyll destroye from Ahab, euen hym that maketh water agaynst the wall, and him that is presoned and forsaken in Israel:
2Kgs.9.9	and I wyll make the house of Ahab lyke the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and lyke the house of Baasa the sonne of Ahia.
2Kgs.9.10	And as for Iezabel the dogges shall eate her in the felde of Iezrael, and ther shalbe none to burye her. And he opened the dore, and fledd.
2Kgs.9.11	Iehu came out to the seruauntes of hys lorde, and one sayde vnto hym, is all well? Wherfore came thys madd felowe to the? And he sayde vnto them: ye knowe what maner of man it is, and what hys communicacyon is.
2Kgs.9.12	They sayde vnto hym agayne: it is not so, tell vs. He sayde: thus and thus spake he to me, sayinge: Thus sayth the Lorde: I haue anoynted the to be kynge ouer Israel.
2Kgs.9.13	Then they besyde the horologye hasted, and toke euery man hys garment, and put it vnder hym, and blewe with trompettes, sayinge: Iehu is kynge.
2Kgs.9.14	And so, Iehu the sonne of Iehosaphat the sonne of Nimsi conspyred agaynst Ioram. Ioram kepte Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel because of Hazael kynge of Siria:
2Kgs.9.15	and kynge Ioram returned to be healed in Iezrahel, of the woundes which the Sirians had geuen him, when he fought with Hazael kynge of Siria. And Iehu sayde: If it be youre myndes, then let no man departe and scape out of the citye, to go, Ꟶ tell in Iezrahel.
2Kgs.9.16	So Iehu gatt vp into a charette, and wente to Iezrahel, where Ioram laye, Ꟶ Ahaziahu kyng of Iuda was come downe thither to se Ioram.
2Kgs.9.17	And the watchman that stode on the towre in Iezrael, spyed the company of Iehu as he came, and sayde: I se a companye. And Iehoram sayd: take an horsman, and sende to mete them, that he maye aske whether it be peace.
2Kgs.9.18	And so there went one on horsbacke to mete him, and sayde: thus sayth the kynge: is it peace? and Iehu sayde: what hast thou to do with peace? turne the behynde me. And the wathman tolde, sayinge: the messenger came to them, but he commeth not agayne.
2Kgs.9.19	Then he sent out another on horsbacke, which came to them, and sayde: thus saythe the kynge: is it peace? Iehu answered: what hast thou to do with peace? turne the behind me.
2Kgs.9.20	And the watchman tolde, sayinge: he came to them also, and commeth not agayne, and the driuynge is lyke the driuynge of Iehu the sonne of Nimsi: for he driueth the charet as he were madd.
2Kgs.9.21	And Iehoram sayde: make ready. And the charet was made ready. And Iehoram kinge of Israel, and Ahaziahu kynge of Iuda went out ether of them in hys charet agaynst Iehu, and met hym in the furlonge of Naboth the Iezraelite.
2Kgs.9.22	And it fortuned, that when Iehoram sawe Iehu, he sayde: is it peace Iehu? He answered: What peace shulde there be, so longe as the whordoms of thy mother Iezabel, and her witchcraftes are so great?
2Kgs.9.23	And Iehoram turned his handes, and fledd, and sayde to Ahaziahu: ther is falshed, o Ahaziahu.
2Kgs.9.24	And Iehu toke a bowe in hys handes, and smote Iehoram betwene the armes, Ꟶ the arowe went thorowe hys hert. And he fell downe flatt in hys charet.
2Kgs.9.25	Then sayde Iehu to Bidkar a captayne: take him, Ꟶ cast him in the platt of the grounde of Naboth the Iezraelite. For I remembre that whan I and thou roade together in a charet after Ahab his father, the Lorde layed this heuy burthen vpon hym.
2Kgs.9.26	I haue sene yesterdaye the bloud of Naboth, Ꟶ the bloude of his sonnes, sayde the Lord: Ꟶ I will quyte it the in this ground, sayth the Lorde. Nowe therfore take him, Ꟶ cast hym in the plat of ground, accordyng to the worde of the Lorde.
2Kgs.9.27	But when Ahaziahu the kynge of Iuda sawe this, he fledd by the waye of the garden house. And Iehu folowed after hym, Ꟶ sayde: smyte him also in the charet: in hys charet. at the goynge vp to Gur by Iiblean, Ꟶ he fleed to Magiddo, Ꟶ ther dyed.
2Kgs.9.28	And his seruauntes caried hym in a charet to Ierusalem, Ꟶ buryed hym there in his sepulchre, wt his fathers, in the citie of Dauid.
2Kgs.9.29	And in the .xi. yere of Ioram the sonne of Ahab, beganne Ahaziahu to raygne ouer Iuda.
2Kgs.9.30	And when Iehu was come to Iezrahel Iezabel hearde of it, Ꟶ starched her face, Ꟶ tired her heed, Ꟶ loked out at a windowe.
2Kgs.9.31	And as Iehu entred at the gate, she sayde: had zimri peace which slue hys master?
2Kgs.9.32	And he lyft vp his eyes to the windowe, and sayde: who is of my syde, who? And ther loked out to hym two or thre chamberlaynes.
2Kgs.9.33	And he sayde: throwe her downe. So they threwe her downe, and her bloude dasshed towarde the wall, Ꟶ toward the horses, and he troade her vnder fote.
2Kgs.9.34	And when he was come in, he dyd eate Ꟶ drincke, Ꟶ sayde: go Ꟶ vyset I praye you yonder cursed creature, and burie her: for she is a kynges daughter.
2Kgs.9.35	And so when they came to burye her, they founde nomore of her then the skulle, and the fete, and the palmes of her handes.
2Kgs.9.36	Wherfore they come agayne, Ꟶ told hym. And he sayde: thys is the worde of the Lorde, which he spake by the hande of his seruaunt Elia the Thesbite, sayinge: in the felde of Iezrahel shall dogges eate the flessh of Iezabel.
2Kgs.9.37	And so the carkas of Iezabel was euen as donge vpon the earth, in the felde of Iezrahel: so that no man myght saye: Thys was Iezabel.
2Kgs.10.1	Ahab had .lxx. sonnes in Samaria. And Iehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria vnto the rulers of Iezrael, to the elders, and to them that brought vp Ahabs children, sayinge:
2Kgs.10.2	nowe whan thys letter commeth to you, ye that haue with you your masters sonnes, ye haue with you both charettes and horses: a strong citye haue ye also: and harnes,
2Kgs.10.3	loke which of your masters sonnes is best and most mete, and set hym on hys fathers seate, and fyght for youre Lordes house.
2Kgs.10.4	But they were exceadingly afrayde, Ꟶ sayde: se, two kinges were not able to stande before hym, how shall we then be able to stande?
2Kgs.10.5	And he that was gouerner of Ahabs house, and he that ruled the citye, the elders also, Ꟶ the tutours sent to Iehu, saieng: we are thy seruauntes, Ꟶ will do all that thou shalt byd vs: we wyll make no man kynge: therfore do thou what semeth good in thine eyes.
2Kgs.10.6	Then he wrote another letter to them, sayinge: If ye be myne, and wyll herken vnto my voyce, then take the hedes of the men that are youre masters sonnes, and come to me to Iezrahel by to morowe thys tyme. And the kynges sonnes were .lxx. personnes, and they were with the great men of the citye, which brought them vp.
2Kgs.10.7	And when the letter came to them, they toke the kynges chyldren, and slue them, euen .lxx. personnes, Ꟶ layed theyr heedes in baskettes, and sent them to him to Iezrahel.
2Kgs.10.8	And there came a messenger, and tolde hym, sayinge: they haue brought the heedes of the kynges sonnes. And he sayde: let them laye them on two heapes in the enterynge in of the gate, vntyll the mornynge.
2Kgs.10.9	And whan it was daye, he went out, and stode, Ꟶ sayde to all the folke: ye be ryghteous. Beholde, I conspired against my master, and slue him. But who slue all these?
2Kgs.10.10	Lerne here, that ther shall fall vnto the erth nothyng of the worde of the Lorde, which he spake concerning the house of Ahab. For the Lord hath brought to passe the thinges that he spake by the hande of his seruaunt Elia.
2Kgs.10.11	And so Iehu slue all that remayned of the house of Ahab, in Iezrahel: and all that were great wt him, Ꟶ his kynsfolkes and his prestes, so that he let nothing of him remayne.
2Kgs.10.12	And he arose, Ꟶ departed, Ꟶ came to Samaria. And whan Iehu was in the waye to the house where the shepherdes dyd shere their shepe,
2Kgs.10.13	he met wt the brethren of Ahaziahu king of Iuda, Ꟶ sayde: what are ye? They answered: the brethren of Ahaziahu are we, and go downe to salute the children of the kinge and of the quene.
2Kgs.10.14	And he sayde: take them alyue. Whom when they had taken them alyue, they slue them at the well which was besyde the house where the shepe are shoren, euen two and fourtye men, nether left he any of them.
2Kgs.10.15	And when he was departed thence, he met wt Iehonadab the sonne of Rechab commynge agaynst him. And he blessed him, Ꟶ sayde to hym: is thyne hert ryght, as myne hert is true wt thine? And Iehonadab answered: yea that it is, then geue me thyne hande. And whan he had geuen him his hand, he toke him vp to him into the charet,
2Kgs.10.16	Ꟶ sayde: come wt me, Ꟶ se the zeale that I haue for the Lord: Ꟶ so they made him ryde in hys charet.
2Kgs.10.17	And when he came to Samaria, he slue all that remayned vnto Ahab in Samaria, tyll he had wypte him out, accordyng to the saying of the Lorde which he spake to Elia.
2Kgs.10.18	And Iehu gathered all the people together and sayd vnto them: Ahab serued Baal a lytle. But Iehu shall serue hym more.
2Kgs.10.19	Nowe therfore call vnto me all the prophetes of Baal all soch as serue him, Ꟶ all his prestes, and let none be lackyng. For I haue a greate sacrifyce to do to Baal: Ꟶ therfore, whosoeuer is myssed, he shall not lyue. But Iehu dyd it for a sutteltye, to the intent that he might destroye the seruauntes of Baal.
2Kgs.10.20	And Iehu sayde: Proclayme an holy conuocacyon for Baal,
2Kgs.10.21	and Iehu sent vnto all Israel. And all the seruauntes of Baal came, that ther was not a man lefte behynde that came not. And they came into the house of Baal, Ꟶ the house of Baal was full from one ende to another.
2Kgs.10.22	And he sayde vnto hym that was the keper of the vestrye, bringe forth garmentes for all the seruauntes of Baal. And he brought them out garmentes.
2Kgs.10.23	And when Iehu went with Iehonadab the sonne of Rechab into the house of Baal, he sayde vnto the seruauntes of Baal: searche, and loke, that there be here wt you none of the seruauntes of the Lorde, but the seruauntes of Baal only.
2Kgs.10.24	And when they went in to offer sacrifice Ꟶ burntoffringe: Iehu appoynted .lxxx. men without, Ꟶ sayd: If any of the men whom I haue brought vnder youre handes, escape, he that letteth him go, shall dye for hym.
2Kgs.10.25	And it fortuned, that assone as he had made an ende of offering the burntsacrifyce, Iehu sayde to the men of warre and to the captaines: go in, and sleye them, let none come out. And they smote them with the edge of the swearde. And the men of warre and the captaynes cast them out, and went vnto the citye of the temple of Baal,
2Kgs.10.26	and fet the ymages out of the temple of Baal, and burnt them.
2Kgs.10.27	And they brake the ymage of Baal, Ꟶ brake the house of Baal, Ꟶ made a draft house of it vnto thys daye.
2Kgs.10.28	And so Iehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2Kgs.10.29	But from the synnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to synne: Iehu departed not, nether from folowing of them the golden calues that were in Bethel and in Dan.
2Kgs.10.30	And the Lorde sayde vnto Iehu: because thou hast done ryght well, in bryngynge to passe the thynge that is ryght in myne eyes, and hast done vnto the house of Ahab accordinge to all thinges that are in myne hert, therfore shall thy children vnto the fourth generacyon syt on the seate of Israel.
2Kgs.10.31	But Iehu cared not for this, to walke in the lawe of the Lord God of Israel with all his hert: for he departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam, which made Israel to synne.
2Kgs.10.32	In those dayes the Lorde began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coastes of Israel,
2Kgs.10.33	from Iordan eastwarde: euen all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Rubenites, and them that were of Manasses, from Aroer vnto the ryuer of Arnon: euen Gilead Ꟶ Basan.
2Kgs.10.34	The rest of the wordes that concerne Iehu Ꟶ all that he dyd, and all his power, are they not written in the boke of the Chronycles of the kynges of Israel?
2Kgs.10.35	And Iehu slept wt hys fathers, Ꟶ they buryed him in Samaria, and Iehoahaz his sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.10.36	And the tyme that Iehu raygned vpon Israel in Samaria, is .xxviij. yeres.
2Kgs.11.1	And Athalia the mother of Ahaziahu, when she sawe that her sonne was deed, she arose, and destroyed all the kinges seede.
2Kgs.11.2	But Iehosaba the daughter of kynge Ioram, and syster of Ahaziahu, toke Ioas the sonne of Ahaziahu, and stale hym from amonge the kynges sonnes that were slayne, and his nource with hym, out of a slepynge chambre, and hyd hym from Athalia, that he was not slayne.
2Kgs.11.3	And he was with her hyd in the house of the Lorde .vj. yere. And Athalia did raigne ouer the lande.
2Kgs.11.4	And the .vij. yere Iehoiada sent and fet the rulers ouer hundredes, wt the captaynes, Ꟶ them of the garde, and toke them to hym into the house of the Lorde, and made a bonde wt them, and toke an othe of them in the house of the Lorde, and she wed them the kynges sonne.
2Kgs.11.5	And he commaunded them, saying: thys is it that ye must do: one thyrd parte of you, whose dewty is to come on the Sabboth daye, shall kepe the watch of the kynges house.
2Kgs.11.6	And another thyrde parte shall kepe the gate of Sur: and another thyrd parte shall kepe the gate, which is behynde them of the garde: and so shall ye kepe the watche of the house of Messah,
2Kgs.11.7	Ꟶ two partes of you, that is, all that go out on the Sabboth daye, shall kepe the watche of the house of the Lorde about the kynge,
2Kgs.11.8	and ye shall compasse the kynge rounde about, and euery man shall haue his weapen in his hande. And whosoeuer commeth with in the ranges, let hym be slayne. And se that ye be with the kynge as he goeth out and in.
2Kgs.11.9	And the captaynes ouer the hundredes dyd, according to all thinges that Iehoiada the preste commaunded: and they toke euery man hys men, that were to come in on the Sabboth daye with them that shuld go out on the Sabboth, and came to Iehoiada the preste.
2Kgs.11.10	And to the captaynes ouer hundredes, dyd the preste geue kinge Dauids speares Ꟶ shyldes that were in the temple.
2Kgs.11.11	And they of the garde stode, Ꟶ euery man had his weapen in hys hande rounde about the kynge, from the ryght corner of the temple to the left, alonge by the aultar and the temple.
2Kgs.11.12	And he brought out the kynges sonne, Ꟶ put the crowne vpon him: Ꟶ delyuered hym the witnesse, and made him kyng, Ꟶ anoynted hym. And they clapte their handes, and sayde: God saue the kyng:
2Kgs.11.13	And when Athalia heard the noyse of the runnynge of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the Lorde.
2Kgs.11.14	And when she loked, behold, the kyng stode by a piller, as the maner was, and the syngers Ꟶ the trompettes by the kynge, and all the people of the lande reioysed, and blewe wt trompettes. And Athalia rent her clothes and cryed: treason, treason.
2Kgs.11.15	But Iehoiada the preste commaunded the captaynes of the hundredes that had the rule of the hoost, and sayd vnto them: haue her out without the temple, that she maye be within the ranges, and yf any folowe her, kyll hym with the swearde: for the preste had sayd she maye not be slayne in the house of the Lord.
2Kgs.11.16	And they layde handes on her tyll she came into the waye, by the which the horses went into the kinges palace: Ꟶ there was she slayne.
2Kgs.11.17	And Iehoiada made a bonde betwene the Lorde and the kinge, and the people, that they shuld be the Lordes people, and also betwene the kynge and the people.
2Kgs.11.18	And all the people of the lande went into the house of Baal, and destroyed it, his aultars also, Ꟶ his ymages brake they downe lustely, and slue Mathan the preaste of Baal before the aultars. And the preste set a watch ouer the house of the Lorde,
2Kgs.11.19	and roke the rulars ouer hundredes, the captaynes Ꟶ them of the garde, and all the people of the lande. And they brought the kynge from the house of the Lorde: and came by the waye of the gate of them of the garde to the kynges palace. And he sat hym downe on the seate of the kynges.
2Kgs.11.20	And all the people of the lande reioysed, and the cytye was in quyet. And they slue Athalia wt the swearde besyde the kinges palace.
2Kgs.11.21	Seuen yeare olde was Iehoas, when he beganne to raygne.
2Kgs.12.1	And he beganne to raygne in the .vij. yeare of Iehu .xl. yeare raygned he in Ierusalem: Ꟶ his mothers name was zebiah of Berseba.
2Kgs.12.2	And he did that which was good in the syght of the Lorde, as longe as Iehoiada the preste enfourmed hym.
2Kgs.12.3	But the hylaultars were not taken a waye, for the people offered Ꟶ burnt incense yet vpon the hylaultars.
2Kgs.12.4	And Iehoas sayde to the prestes: all the syluer of dedicat thinges that be brought to the house of the Lorde in curraunt moneye, that is to saye, the money that euery man is set at, and all the money that euery man with a willing hert geueth Ꟶ bringeth into the house of the Lorde,
2Kgs.12.5	let the prestes take it to them, euery man of his aquayntaunce, to repayre the broken places of the house, wheresoeuer any decaye is founde.
2Kgs.12.6	And so it came to passe, that vnto the .xxiij. yere of king Iehoas, the prestes had mended nothing, that was decayed in the temple.
2Kgs.12.7	Then kyng Iehoas called for Iehoiada the bysshop, and the prestes, and sayde vnto them: why repayre ye not the broken places of the temple? Nowe therfore, se that ye receaue nomore money of your aquayntaunce, except ye delyuer it to repayre the temple withall.
2Kgs.12.8	And the prestes consented to receaue nomore money of the people: except to repayre the decayed places of the temple.
2Kgs.12.9	But Iehoiada the preast toke a chest and bored an hoale in the lyd of it, Ꟶ set it besyde the altare on the ryght syde, as euery man commeth into the temple of the Lorde. And the preastes that kepte the vessels, put ther in all the money that was brought into the house of the Lorde.
2Kgs.12.10	And it fortuned, that when they saw there was moche money in the chest, the kynges scribe and the hye preaste came, vp, and tolde the money that was founde in the house of the Lorde, and put it in to a bagg.
2Kgs.12.11	And they gaue the money sealed into the handes of them that executed the worcke, and that had the ouersyght of the house of the Lorde: and they brought it out to the carpenters and buylders (that wrought vpon the house of the Lorde)
2Kgs.12.12	and to masons and hewers of stone: And they bought tymbre and fre stone, to repayre the decay in the house of the Lorde, and to all that went out to mende the temple:
2Kgs.12.13	howebeit there was not made for the house of the Lorde, bowlles of syluer, instrumentes of Musicke, basens, trompettes or any vessells of golde, or vessell of syluer, of the money that was brought in to the house of the Lorde:
2Kgs.12.14	But they gaue that to the worckemen, and repayred therwyth the house of the Lord.
2Kgs.12.15	Moreouer, they rekoned not wyth the men, into whose handes they delyuered that money to be bestowed on worckemen: for they dyd their busynes faythfully.
2Kgs.12.16	Howbeit trespace money and synne money was not brought into the house of the Lorde, for it was the preastes.
2Kgs.12.17	Then came Hazael kynge of Siria vp, and fought agaynst Geth and toke it, Ꟶ Hazael set hys face to go vp to Ierusalem.
2Kgs.12.18	And Ichoas kynge of Iuda toke all the halowed thynges that Iehosaphat, Iehoram and Haziahu his fathers kynges of Iuda, had dedicat, and that he hym selfe had dedicated, and all the golde that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lorde and in the kynges house, and sent it to Hazael kynge of Siria: and so he departed from Ierusalem.
2Kgs.12.19	The remnaunt of the wordes that concerne Iehoas and all that he dyd, are they not written in the boke of the Chronycles of the kynges of Iuda?
2Kgs.12.20	And hys awne seruauntes arose, and wrought treason, and slue Iehoas in the house Millo, whan he came downe to Silla.
2Kgs.12.21	Iozabar the sonne of Semeath and Iehozabad the sonne of Somer hys seruauntes, smote hym, Ꟶ he dyed. And they buryed hym wyth his fathers in the cytie of Dauid. And Amaziahu hys sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.13.1	In the .xxiij. yeare of Ioas the sonne of Ahaziahu kynge of Iuda, Iehoahaz the sonne of Iehu beganne to raygne ouer Israel in Samaria seuentene yeare.
2Kgs.13.2	And he wrought that whych was euell in the syght of the Lorde, and folowed the synnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat whych made Israel to synne, and departed not ther from.
2Kgs.13.3	And the Lorde was angry wyth Israel, and delyuered them into the hand of Hazael kynge of Siria, and into the hande of Benhadad the sonne of Hazael all theyr dayes.
2Kgs.13.4	And Iehoahaz besought the Lorde, Ꟶ the Lorde heard him. For he considred the trouble of Israel, wher with the king of Siria troubled them.
2Kgs.13.5	And the Lorde gaue Israel a delyuerer, so that they went out from vnder the subieccyon of the Sirians. And the chyldren of Israel dwelt in theyr tentes as before tyme.
2Kgs.13.6	Neuerthelesse they departed not from the synnes of the house of Ieroboam, whych made Israel synne, but walked in them. And there remayned an Idols groue styll also in Samaria.
2Kgs.13.7	Neither dyd he leaue of the people to Iehoahaz, but fyftye horsemen ten charettes, Ꟶ ten thousande fotemen for the kynge of Siria destroyed them, and made them lyke thresshed dust.
2Kgs.13.8	The rest of the wordes that concerne Iehoahaz, and all that he dyd, and hys power, are they not wrytten in the boke of the Chronycles of the kynges of Israel?
2Kgs.13.9	And Iehoahaz slepte wyth hys fathers, and they buryed hym in Samaria, and Ioas his sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.13.10	In the .xxxvij. yeare of Ioas kynge of Iuda, beganne Iehoas the sonne of Iehoahaz to raygne ouer Israel in Samaria syxtene yeare,
2Kgs.13.11	and dyd that whych is euell in the syght of the Lord, and departed not from all the synnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, (that made Israel synne) for he walked therin.
2Kgs.13.12	The remnaunt of the wordes that concerne Ioas Ꟶ all that he dyd, Ꟶ hys power wher wyth he fought agaynst Amaziahu kyng of Iuda are they not wrytten in the chronycle boke of the kynges of Israel?
2Kgs.13.13	And Ioas slepte with his fathers, and Ieroboam sat vpon his seate. And Ioas was buried in Samaria amonge the kynges of Israel.
2Kgs.13.14	When Elisa was fallen sycke of hys sycknesse (wher of he dyed) Ioas the kinge of Israel came downe vnto hym, Ꟶ wepte before him, Ꟶ sayd: O my father, my father, the charet of Israel, Ꟶ the horsemen of the same.
2Kgs.13.15	Elisa sayde vnto hym: take bowe Ꟶ arowes.
2Kgs.13.16	And he toke vnto him bowe Ꟶ arowes. And he sayde to the kyng of Israel: put thine hand vpon the bowe, Ꟶ he put his hande vpon it. And Elisa put his handes vpon the kinges handes,
2Kgs.13.17	Ꟶ sayde: open a windowe eastward: Ꟶ whan he had opened it, Elisa sayde: shote, Ꟶ he shotte. And he sayd: the arowe of helth of the Lord: and the arowe of helth agaynst Siria, for thou shalt smyte Siria in Aphek, tyll thou haue made an ende of them.
2Kgs.13.18	And he sayd: take the arowes: Ꟶ he toke them: And he sayd vnto the kyng of Israel: smyte the grounde: Ꟶ he smote thrise and ceased.
2Kgs.13.19	And the man of God was angrie wt him, Ꟶ sayd: thou shuldest haue smyten fyue or syxe tymes Ꟶ then thou haddest smytten Siria tyll thou haddest made an ende of them: where nowe thou shalt smyte Siria but thrise.
2Kgs.13.20	And so Elisa dyed and they buryed hym, Ꟶ the soudiares of the Moabites came into the land, the same yeare.
2Kgs.13.21	And it chaunced as some of them were burienge a man, and spyed the soudyars, they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisa. And whan the man was rolled downe, and touched the body of Elisa he reuyued, and stode vpon hys fete.
2Kgs.13.22	But Hazael vexed Israel, all the dayes of Iehoahaz.
2Kgs.13.23	And the Lord had mercye on them Ꟶ pitied them, Ꟶ had respecte vnto them, because of his appointment made wt Abraham, Isahac Ꟶ Iacob, and wolde not destroye them, nether cast he them from hym as yet.
2Kgs.13.24	So Hazael the kynge of Siria dyed and Benhadad his sonne raygned in his steade.
2Kgs.13.25	And Iehoas the sonne of Iehoahaz went agayne, and toke out of the hande of Benhadad the sonne of Hazael, the cyties which he had taken awaye out of the hande of Iehoahaz hys father, in warre: for thre tymes dyd Ioas beate him, and restored the cyties vnto Israel agayne.
2Kgs.14.1	The seconde yere of Ioas sonne of Iehoahaz kynge of Israel raygned Amaziahu the sonne of Ioas kynge of Iuda:
2Kgs.14.2	he was .xxv. yeare olde when he began to raygne, and raigned .xxix. yeare in Ierusalem, Ꟶ hys mothers name was Iehoadan, of Ieru salem.
2Kgs.14.3	And he dyd that which is good in the syght of the Lorde, yet not lyke Dauid his father: but dyd accordynge to all thynges as Ioas hys father dyd.
2Kgs.14.4	Nether were the hyllaulters taken awaye: For as yet the people dyd sacrifice Ꟶ burnt incense on the hyllaulters.
2Kgs.14.5	And assone as the kyngdome was setteled in hys hande it came to passe, that he slue hys seruauntes which had kylled the kynge hys father.
2Kgs.14.6	But the chyldren of those murtherars he slue not, accordynge vnto it that is written in the boke of the lawe of Moses: where in the Lorde commaunded, sayinge: let not the fathers dye for the chyldren, nor let the chyldren be slayne for the fathers: But let euery man be put to death for his awne sinne.
2Kgs.14.7	He slue of Edom in the salt valeye ten thousande, and toke the castell on the rock in the same battell, Ꟶ called the name of it Ioktheel vnto this daye.
2Kgs.14.8	Then Amaziahu sent messengers to Iehoas the sonne of Iehoahaz sonne of Iehu kynge of Israel, sayinge: come, let vs se eche other.
2Kgs.14.9	And Iehoas the kynge of Israel sent to Amaziahu kynge of Iuda, sayinge: dyd not a thystle that is in libanon, sende to a Cedre tre that is in Libanon, sayinge: geue thy daughter to my sonne to wyfe: And the wylde beaste that was in Libanon, went and troade downe the thistell.
2Kgs.14.10	Thou hast smytten Edom, thyne hart hath made the proude: Enioye thys glory, Ꟶ tarye at home. Why dost thou prouoke to mischeue, that thou shuldest be ouerthrowen, and Iuda wyth the?
2Kgs.14.11	But Amaziahu wolde not heare. And Iehoas kynge of Israel went vp, and he and Amaziahu kynge of Iuda sawe ether other at Bethsames whych is in Iuda.
2Kgs.14.12	And Iuda was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled euery man to theyr tentes.
2Kgs.14.13	And Iehoas kinge of Israel toke Amaziahu king of Iuda, the sonne of Iehoas the sonne of Ahaziahu, at Bethsames, and came to Ierusalem Ꟶ brake downe the wall of Ierusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, foure hundred cubytes.
2Kgs.14.14	And he toke all the golde and syluer and all the vesselles that were founde in the house of the Lorde, Ꟶ in the treasures of the kynges house, and the chyldren toke he to be hys wardes Ꟶ returned to Samaria agayne.
2Kgs.14.15	The rest of the actes of Iehoas which he dyd, Ꟶ hys power, and howe he fought with Amaziahu kyng of Iuda, are they not written in the Chronycle boke of the kynges of Israel?
2Kgs.14.16	and Iehoas slepte with his fathers, and was buryed at Samaria, amonge the kynges of Israel: and Ieroboam hys sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.14.17	Amaziahu the sonne of Ioas kynge of Iuda, lyued after the deeth of Iehoas sonne of Iehoahaz kynge of Israel, fyftene yeare.
2Kgs.14.18	And the remnaunt of the wordes that concerne Amaziahu, are they not wrytten in the boke of the Chronycles of the kynges of Iuda?
2Kgs.14.19	But they conspired treason agaynst him in Ierusalem: and whan he fled to Lachis, they sent after him to Lachis, and slue hym there.
2Kgs.14.20	And they brought hym on horses, Ꟶ he was buryed at Ierusalem wyth hys fathers in the cytie of Dauid.
2Kgs.14.21	And all the people of Iuda toke Azaria, whych was .xvi. yere olde, and made hym kynge for hys father Amaziahu.
2Kgs.14.22	He buylt Elath, and brought it agayne to Iuda, after that the kynge was layde to rest wyth hys fathers.

2Kgs.14.24	and wrought that which was euell in the syght of the Lorde. Nether turned he awaye from all the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat which made Israel to synne.
2Kgs.14.25	He restored the coaste of Israel from the enterynge of Hemath vnto the see of the wildernes, according to the worde of the Lorde God of Israel, which he spake by the hande of his seruaunt Iona the sonne of Amithai the prophete, which was of Geth hepher.
2Kgs.14.26	For the Lorde sawe howe that the afflyccyon of Israel was exceadynge bytter, in so moche that the presoned and the forsaken were at an ende. And ther was none to helpe Israel.
2Kgs.14.27	And the Lorde sayde not, that he wolde putt out the name of Israel from vnder heauen, but he helped them by the hande of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioas.
2Kgs.14.28	The rest of the wordes that concerne Ieroboam, and all that he dyd, and hys strength, which he executed in the warres, and howe he restored Damasco, and Heniath to Iuda in Israel, are not they written in the boke of the chronycles of the kynges of Israel?
2Kgs.14.29	And Ieroboam slepte with hys fathers, euen wt the kynges of Israel, and zacharia his sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.15.1	In the .xxvij. yere of Ieroboam kinge of Israel, beganne Azaria sonne of Amazia kynge of Iuda to raygne.
2Kgs.15.2	Syxtene yeare olde was he when he was made king, and he raygned two and fyftye yeare in Ierusalem, and hys mothers name was Iecholeiahu of Ierusalem.

2Kgs.15.4	saue that the hylaultars. were not put awaye: for the people offered, and burned incense styll on the hylaultars.

2Kgs.15.8	In the .xxxviij. yere of Azaria kynge of Iuda dyd zacharia the sonne of Ieroboam raigne vpon Israel in Samaria .vj. monethes:
2Kgs.15.9	and wrought that which was euell in the syght of the Lorde, as dyd hys fathers: and turned not awaye from the synnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to sinne.
2Kgs.15.10	And Sallum the sonne of Iabes conspyred against hym, Ꟶ smote hym in the syght of the people, Ꟶ kylled him, Ꟶ raygned in his steade.
2Kgs.15.11	The rest of the wordes that concerne zacharia, beholde, they are wrytten in the boke of the Chronycles of the kynges of Israel.
2Kgs.15.12	Thys is also the worde of the Lorde, which he spake vnto Iehu, sayinge: thy sonnes shall syt on the seate of Israel in the fourth generacion after the. And it came so to passe.
2Kgs.15.13	Sallum the sonne of Iabes beganne to raygne in the .xxxix. yere of Azaria kynge of Iuda: Ꟶ he raygned a moneth in Samaria.
2Kgs.15.14	For Menahem the sonne of Gadi went vp from Thirza, Ꟶ came to Samaria, Ꟶ smote Sallum the sonne of Iabes in Samaria, Ꟶ slue him, Ꟶ raygned in his steade.

2Kgs.15.19	And Phul the kinge of Assiria came vpon the lande. And Menahem gaue Phul a .M. talentes of syluer, that his hand might be with him and stablyshe the kyngdome in his hande.
2Kgs.15.20	And Menahem made a proclamacion for the money in Israel, that all men of substaunce shulde geue the kynge of Assiria fyftye sycles of syluer a pece. And so the kyng of Assiria turned back agayne, and taryed not there in the lande.
2Kgs.15.21	The rest of the wordes that concerne Menahem, and all that he dyd, are they not wrytten in the boke of the chronicles of the kinges of Israel?
2Kgs.15.22	And Menahem slepte with his fathers, Ꟶ Pekahia his sonne dyd in his steade succede him in the kyngedome.
2Kgs.15.23	In the fyftyth yeare of Azaria kynge of Iuda, beganne Pekahia the sonne of Menahem to raygne ouer Israel in Samaria two yere,
2Kgs.15.24	Ꟶ dyd that which was euell in the sight of the Lorde: and lefte not of from the synnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel synne.

2Kgs.15.27	In the .lij. yere of Azaria kynge of Iuda beganne Pekah the sonne of Remaliahu, to raygne ouer Israel in Samaria .xx. yeare,
2Kgs.15.28	Ꟶ dyd euell in the syght of the Lorde, and turned not awaye from the synnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, that made Israel synne.
2Kgs.15.29	In the dayes of Pekah kyng of Israel, came Thiglath Pelesar kynge of Assiria, and toke Iion, Abel, Bethmaacha, Ianoah, Kedes, Hazor, Gilead, Galile, and all the lande of Nephthali, Ꟶ caryed them awaye to Assiria:
2Kgs.15.30	And Hosea the sonne of Ela conspired treason agaynst Pekah the sonne of Remaliah, and smote him, and slue him: and raygned in hys steade in the .xx. yere of Iotham the sonne of Uziahu.
2Kgs.15.31	The rest of the wordes that concerne Pekah and all that he dyd, behold, they are wrytten in the boke of the chronycles of the kynges of Israel.
2Kgs.15.32	The seconde yeare of Pekah the sonne of Remaliahu kinge of Israel, beganne Iotham the sonne of Uziahu kynge of Iuda to raygne.
2Kgs.15.33	Fyue and twentye yere olde was he when he began to raygne: and he raygned syxtene yere in Ierusalem. Hys mothers name was Ierusa the daughter of zadok.
2Kgs.15.34	And he dyd that which is ryght in the syght of the Lorde: euen accordynge to all as dyd his father Uziahu, so dyd he.
2Kgs.15.35	But the hylaulters were nott put awaye: for the people offered and burnt incense styll in the hylaulters: he buylt the hygher dore of the house of the Lord.
2Kgs.15.36	The rest of the wordes that concerne Iotham, and all that he dyd, are they not written in the boke of the chronycles of the kynges of Iuda.
2Kgs.15.37	In those dayes the Lorde beganne to sende into Iuda, Rezin the kyng of Siria, and Pekah the sonne of Remaliahu.
2Kgs.15.38	And Iotham slepte wt his fathers, and was buried wt his fathers in the citye of Dauid hys father, and Ahaz hys sonne raygned in his steade.
2Kgs.16.1	The .xvij. yeare of Pekah the sonne of Remaliahu kynge of Israel, Ahaz the sonne of Iotham kynge of Iuda, beganne to raygne.
2Kgs.16.2	Twentye yere olde was he, when he was made kynge: and raygned syxtene yere in Ierusalem, and dyd not that which was ryght in the eyes of the Lorde hys God, lyke Dauid hys father:
2Kgs.16.3	But walked in the waye of the kynges of Israel, yee, and made hys sonne to go thorowe the fyer, after the abhominacyons of the Heythen, whom the Lorde cast out before the chyldren of Israel.
2Kgs.16.4	And he offered and burnt incense in the hilaulters and on the hylles, and vnder euery thick tree.
2Kgs.16.5	Then Rezin kynge of Siria and Pekah sonne of Remaliahu kynge of Israel came vp to Ierusalem to fyght. And they fought agaynst Ahaz, but could not ouercome hym.
2Kgs.16.6	At the same tyme Rezin kynge of Siria brought Elath agayne to Siria, and rydd the Iewes thence. And the Sirians came to Elath, and dwell therin vnto thys daye.
2Kgs.16.7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Thiglath Peleser kynge of Assiria, sayinge: I am thy seruaunt and thy sonne, come vp and deliuer me out of the hande of the kynge of Siria, Ꟶ out of the hande of the king of Israel, which ryse vp agaynst me.
2Kgs.16.8	And Ahaz toke the syluer and the golde that was founde in the house of the Lorde, and in the treasures of the kinges house, and sent a rewarde to the kyng of Assiria.
2Kgs.16.9	And the kynge of Assiria consented vnto hym. For the kynge of Assiria went vp agaynst Damasco. And when he had take it, he caryed the people awaye to Kyr, and slue Rezin.
2Kgs.16.10	And kynge Ahaz went to Damasco, to mete Thiglath Peleser king of Assiria. And when kynge Ahaz sawe an aulter that was at Damasco, he sent to Uria the preste the paterne of the aulter, Ꟶ the fassyon of it, and all the worckmanshyp therof.
2Kgs.16.11	And Uria the preste made an aulter in all poyntes lyke to the patern which kinge Ahaz had sent from Damasco: euen so dyd Uria the preste make it, agaynst king Ahaz came from Damasco.
2Kgs.16.12	And so, when the kyng was come from Damasco, he sawe the aulter, and the kyng went to it, Ꟶ offered theron.
2Kgs.16.13	And he burnt his burntofferinge, and hys meatofferinge, and powred hys drynckofferynge: and sprynckled the bloude of hys peace offerynges besyde the aulter,
2Kgs.16.14	that was by the brasen aulter which was before the Lord, and set it wtout the temple betwene the aulter and the temple of the Lord: and put it on the northsyde of the aultare.
2Kgs.16.15	And kynge Ahaz commaunded Uria the preste, and sayde: vpon the greate aulter set on fyer in the mornyng the burntofferinge, Ꟶ in the euen the meatoffering, and the kinges burntsacrifyce Ꟶ his meatofferinge, with the burntofferyng of all the people of the lande, and their meatofferinge, Ꟶ their drynckofferinges: Ꟶ powre therby, all the bloude of the sacrifyce offringes. But the brasen aulter will I come and se.
2Kgs.16.16	And Uria the preste dyd accordynge to all thynges as kynge. Ahaz commaunded hym.
2Kgs.16.17	And kynge Ahaz brake the sydes of the botomes, and toke the lauer from of them, and toke downe the Lauatorye from of the brasen oxen that were vnder it, Ꟶ put it vpon a pauement of stones.
2Kgs.16.18	And the veyle for the Sabboth (that they had made in the house) Ꟶ the kynges entrye without turned he to the house of the Lorde, for (feare of) the kynge of Assyria.
2Kgs.16.19	The reste of the wordes that concerne Ahaz, what he dyd, are they not written in the boke of the Chronicles of the kynges of Iuda?
2Kgs.16.20	And Ahaz slepte with hys fathers, and was buryed with hys fathers in the cytie of Dauid: and Hezekia his sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.17.1	In the .xii. yeare of Ahaz kynge of Iuda, beganne Hosea the sonne of Ela to raigne in Samaria vpon Israel .ix. yeare,
2Kgs.17.2	and dyd that which was euell in the syght of the Lorde, but not as the kynges of Israel that were before him.
2Kgs.17.3	And Salmanasar kyng of Assyria came vp agaynst him, and Hosea became hys seruaunt, and gaue hym presentes.
2Kgs.17.4	And the kynge of Assyria founde treason in Hosea: for he had sent messengers to So, kynge of Egypte, and brought no presente vnto the kynge of Assyria, from yeare to yeare: and therfore the kynge of Assyria toke hym: and put hym in pryson.
2Kgs.17.5	And then the kynge of Assyria came vp thorowout all the lande, Ꟶ gat vp against Samaria, and beseged it thre yeare.
2Kgs.17.6	In the nynth yeare of Hosea, the kynge of Assyria toke Samaria, and caryed Israel awaye vnto Assyria, and put them in Hala, in Habor by the ryuer of Goza, and in the cyties of the Medes.
2Kgs.17.7	For it came to passe, that the chyldren of Israel synned agaynst the Lorde theyr God, which had brought them out of the lande of Egypt, from vnder the hande of Pharao kynge of Egypte: and feared other Gods.
2Kgs.17.8	And they walked in the ceremonyes of the hethen, whom the Lorde cast out before the chyldren of Israel, Ꟶ in the ceremonies which the kynges of Israel had made.
2Kgs.17.9	And the children of Israel went about to hyde those thinges that were not well, from the Lorde theyr God. And they buylt them Hyllaulters in all theyr cyties, bothe in the towres where they kept watch, and also in the stronge townes.
2Kgs.17.10	And they made them ymages and groues in euery hye hyll, and vnder euery thyck tre.
2Kgs.17.11	And there they burnt incense in all the Hyllaulters, as dyd the hethen (whom the Lorde caryed awaye before them) and wrought wycked thynges to angre the Lorde withall:
2Kgs.17.12	For they serued most vyle Idoles, wherof the Lorde had sayde vnto them. Ye shall do no soche thynge.
2Kgs.17.13	And the Lorde testifyed in Israel, and in Iuda by all the prophetes and by all the sears, sayinge. Turne from youre wycked wayes and kepe my commaundementes and my statutes, accordinge to all the lawe which I commaunded youre fathers, and which I sent to you by my seruauntes the prophetes.
2Kgs.17.14	Notwithstandynge they wolde not heare but rather hardened theyr neckes, lyke to the stubburnesse of their fathers that dyd not beleue in the Lorde their God.
2Kgs.17.15	For they refused hys statutes, and hys appoyntment that he made with theyr fathers, Ꟶ the witnesses (wherwith he witnessed vnto them) Ꟶ they folowed vanyte, and became vayne, and went after the hethen that were rounde aboute them: concernynge whom, the Lorde had charged them, that they shuld not do lyke them.
2Kgs.17.16	But they left the commaundementes of the Lord theyr God and made them Images of metall euen two calues: and made Idole groues, Ꟶ worshypped all the Hoste of heauen, and serued Baall.
2Kgs.17.17	And they sacrifyced theyr sonnes Ꟶ theyr daughters in fyre, and vsed witchcraft and enchauntementes euen sellynge them selues to worke wyckednesse in the syght of the Lorde, and to angre hym.
2Kgs.17.18	And the Lorde was exceadinge wroth wt Israel and put them out of hys syght that there was lefte but the trybe of Iuda onely.
2Kgs.17.19	Neuertheles, Iuda also kept not the commaundementes of the Lorde theyr God, but walked in the ceremonies of Israel, which they made
2Kgs.17.20	And the Lorde cast vp all the seed of Israel, and vexed them, and delyuered them into the handes of spoylers, vntyll he had cast them out of hys syght.
2Kgs.17.21	For Israel deuyded them selues from the house of Dauid, Ꟶ made them a kinge, euen Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat. And Ieroboam drewe Israel awaye (that they shulde not folowe the Lorde) and made them synne a greate synne:
2Kgs.17.22	For the chyldren of Israel walcked in all the synnes of Ieroboam which he dyd, and departed not therfrom,
2Kgs.17.23	vntyll the Lorde put Israel awaye out of hys syght, as he had sayde by all hys seruauntes the prophetes. And so was Israel caryed awaye out of theyr awne lande to Assyria euen vnto thys daye.
2Kgs.17.24	And the kynge of Assyria brought men from Babylon, from Cutha, from Aua, from Hanath, and from Sepharuaim, and put them in the cyties of Samaria, in steade of the chyldren of Israel. And they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cyties therof.
2Kgs.17.25	And it fortuned, that at the begynnynge of theyr dwellinge there, they feared not the Lorde. And the Lorde sent lyons amonge them, which slue them.
2Kgs.17.26	Wherfore, men sayde to the kynge of Assyria. The nacyons which thou hast translated, Ꟶ put in the cyties of Samaria, knowe not the lawe of the God of the lande, therfore he hath sent lyons vpon them: and beholde they slaye them, because they knowe not the maner of worshyppyng of the God of the lande.
2Kgs.17.27	Then the kynge of Assyria commaunded sayenge: carye thether one or twayne of the Preastes, whom ye brought thence, and let them go, and dwell there, and teache them the fassyon howe to serue the God of the contreye.
2Kgs.17.28	And then one of the Preastes which they had caryed thence came, and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them howe they shulde feare the Lorde.
2Kgs.17.29	Howbeit euery nacyon made them Gods of theyr awne and put them in the houses of the Hyllaulters which the Samaritans had made, euery nacion in their cyties wherin they dwelt.
2Kgs.17.30	The men of Babilon made Socoth Benoth: and the men of Cuth made Nergal: and the men of Hamath made Asima.
2Kgs.17.31	The Auites made Nibbaz, and Tharthak. And the Sepharuites burnt theyr chyldren in fyre for Adramelech and Anamelech, the Gods of Sepharuaim.
2Kgs.17.32	And so they feared the Lorde, and made them Preastes of the Hyllaulters, which sacrifyced for them in the houses of the Hyllaulters.
2Kgs.17.33	And so they feared the Lorde, and serued theyr awne Gods after the maner of the people, whom they caryed thence.
2Kgs.17.34	And vnto this daye they do after the olde maner: and nether feare God, nether do after theyr ordinaunces and customes, and after the lawe and commaundement which the Lorde commaunded the chyldren of Iacob, whom he called Israel.
2Kgs.17.35	And the Lorde made an appoyntement wyth them, and charged them, sayenge: feare none other Goddes, nor bowe youre selues to them, nor serue them nor sacrifyce to them:
2Kgs.17.36	but feare the Lord which brought you out of the lande of Egypte with greate power and a stretched out arme: hym feare, and to hym bowe, and to hym do sacrifyce.
2Kgs.17.37	The statutes, ordinaunces, lawe and commaundement which he wrote for you, se that ye be diligent to do for euermore, Ꟶ feare not any other goddes.
2Kgs.17.38	And the appoyntement that I haue made with you, se ye forget not and feare none other goddes:
2Kgs.17.39	but the Lorde youre God ye shall feare, and he shall deliuer you out of the handes of all youre enemyes.
2Kgs.17.40	Howbeit, they dyd not herken, but dyd after theyr olde custome.
2Kgs.17.41	And so these nacions feared the Lorde, and serued theyr ymages also: lyke as dyd theyr chyldren and theyr chyldrens chyldren. Euen as dyd theyr fathers, so do they vnto thys daye.
2Kgs.18.1	In the thyrde yere of Hosea sonne of Ela kynge of Israel it came to passe, that Hezekia the sonne of Ahaz kyng of Iuda dyd raynge.
2Kgs.18.2	Twentye and fyue yere olde was he, when he beganne to raygne, and raygned .xxix. yere in Ierusalem. His mothers name also was Abi the daughter of zacharia,
2Kgs.18.3	and he dyd that which is ryght in the syght of the Lorde accordyng to all as dyd Dauid hys father.
2Kgs.18.4	He put awaye the hyllaulters, and brake the ymages and cut downe the groues, and all to brake the brasen serpent that Moses had made: For vnto those dayes the chyldren of Israel dyd burne sacrifice to it, Ꟶ he called it Nehustan.
2Kgs.18.5	He trusted in the Lorde God of Israel, so that after hym was none lyke him amonge all the kynges of Iuda, nether were there anye soche before hym.
2Kgs.18.6	For he claue to the Lorde; and departed not from hym, but kepte hys commaundementes, which the Lorde commaunded Moses.
2Kgs.18.7	And the Lorde was with hym: so that he prospered in all thynges which he toke in hande. And he rebelled agaynst the kynge of Assyria, and serued him not.
2Kgs.18.8	He smote the Philistines euen vnto Aza and the coastes therof, both castels where they kepte watches: and stronge cyties.
2Kgs.18.9	And in the fourth yeare of kynge Hezekia, (which was the seuenth yeare of Hosea sonne of Ela kynge of Israell) it fortuned, that Salmanazar kyng of Assyria came vp agaynst Samaria, Ꟶ beseged it.
2Kgs.18.10	And after thre yeres they toke it euen in the syxte yere of Hezekia: that is to saye, the nynth yere of Hosea kynge of Israel. And Samaria was wonne.
2Kgs.18.11	And the kynge of Assyria, dyd carye awaye Israel vnto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the ryuer of Gozan, and in the cyties of the Medes:
2Kgs.18.12	because they wolde not herken vnto the voyce of the Lorde theyr God: but transgressed hys appoyntment, and all that Moses the seruaunt of the Lord commaunded, Ꟶ wolde nether heare them nor do them.
2Kgs.18.13	Therfore in the .xiiii. yeare of kynge Hezekia dyd Sennacherib kynge of Assyria come vp agaynst all the stronge cytyes of Iuda, and toke them.
2Kgs.18.14	And Hezekia kynge of Iuda sent to the kynge of Assyria to Lachis, saying: I haue offended: departe from me, and all that thou puttest on me, that will I beare. And the kynge of Assyria appoynted vnto Hezekia kynge of Iuda thre hundred talentes of syluer, Ꟶ thirtye talentes of gold.
2Kgs.18.15	And Hezekia gaue him all the syluer that was founde in the house of the Lorde, Ꟶ in the treasures of the kynges house.
2Kgs.18.16	At the same ceason dyd Hezekia rent of the dores of the temple of the Lorde Ꟶ the pillers (whych the sayde Hezekia kynge of Iuda had couered ouer) Ꟶ gaue them to the kynge of Assyria.
2Kgs.18.17	And the kynge of Assyria sent Tharthan and Rabsaris and Rabsake from Lachis to kynge Hezekia with a great Hoste agaynst Ierusalem. And they went vp, and came to Ierusalem, Ꟶ gat them vp, Ꟶ stode by the conduyte of the vpper pole which is in the waye of the fullers felde.
2Kgs.18.18	And whan they had called to the kynge, there came out to them, Eliakim the sonne of Elkia which was stuarde of housholde, and Sobna the scribe, Ꟶ Ioah the sonne of Asaph, the recorder.
2Kgs.18.19	And Rabsake sayde vnto them: Tell ye Hezekia I praye you: thus sayth the great kynge, euen the kynge of Assyria: What confidence is this that thou hast? Dost thou speake soche a lyght worde in dede?
2Kgs.18.20	By councell and power I wilbe ready to make warre. On whom then doest thou trust, that thou rebellest agaynst me?
2Kgs.18.21	dost thou truste to the staffe of this broken rede Egypte, on which yf a man leane, it wyll go into his hande, and pearce it. Euen so is Pharao kynge of Egypte vnto all that trust on him.
2Kgs.18.22	If ye saye vnto me, we trust in the Lorde oure God: Is not that he whose hilaulters and his other aulters, Hezekia hath put downe, and hath sayde to Iuda Ꟶ Ierusalem, ye shall worshyppe before this aulter here in Ierusalem.
2Kgs.18.23	Nowe therfore delyuer wardes to my Lorde the kynge of Assyria, that ye rebell not, Ꟶ I wyll delyuer the two thousande horses, yf thou be able to sett ryders vpon them:
2Kgs.18.24	Why thynkest thou scorne at the presence of one of the leest Dukes of my masters seruauntes, Ꟶ trustest to Egypte for charettes and horsmen?
2Kgs.18.25	Moreouer, am I come now without the byddinge of the Lorde to this place, to destroye it? the Lorde sayde to me: go vp to this lande, and destroye it.
2Kgs.18.26	And Eliakim the sonne of Helkia Ꟶ Sobna, Ꟶ Ioab sayde vnto Rabsake: speake (I praye the) to thy seruauntes in the Syrians language, for we vnderstande it: Ꟶ talke not wt vs in the Iewes tonge, in the eares of this people that are on the wall.
2Kgs.18.27	And Rabsake sayde vnto them: hath my master sent me to thy master and to the, to speake these wordes? Hath he not sent me because of the men which sytt on the wall, that they maye eate their awne donge, Ꟶ dryncke their awne pisse with you?
2Kgs.18.28	And so Rabsake stode, and cryed with a lowde voyce in the Iewes language, and spake sayinge: heare the sayinge of the great kynge of Assyria.
2Kgs.18.29	Thus sayth the kynge: let not Hezekia begile you, for he shall not be able to delyuer you out of myne hande:
2Kgs.18.30	nether let Hezekia make you to trust in the Lorde, sayinge: the Lorde shall surely delyuer vs, and this cytie shall not be geuen ouer into the hande of the kynge of Assyria.
2Kgs.18.31	Herken not vnto Hezekia, for thus sayth the kynge of Assyria. Deale kyndely with me, Ꟶ come out to me. And then eate euery man of his awne vyne, and of his awne fygge tree, Ꟶ dryncke euery man of the water of his awne well,
2Kgs.18.32	tyll I come, and fett you to as good a lande as youres is: a lande of corne and wyne, a lande of bread and vyneyardes, a lande of oyle, of olyue trees, and of hony: that ye maye lyue, and not dye. And herken not vnto Hezekia, for he begyleth you, sayinge: the Lorde shall delyuer vs.
2Kgs.18.33	Hath euery one of the Gods of the nacyons deliuered his lande, out of the hande of the kynge of Assyria?
2Kgs.18.34	where is the God of Hamath, Ꟶ of Arphad? and where is the God of Sepharuaim, Hena Ꟶ Iua? dyd they delyuer Samaria out of myne hande,
2Kgs.18.35	Ꟶ what God is it amonge all the goddes of the nacyons, that hath delyuered his lande out of myne hande, Shall the Lorde deliuer Ierusalem out of myne hande?
2Kgs.18.36	But they that were of the people helde their peace, and answered not him a worde: for the kynge had commaunded, sayinge: answere him not.
2Kgs.18.37	Then Eliakim which was the stuard of housholde, and Sobnah the scribe, and Ioah the sonne of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekia with their clothes rent, and tolde him the wordes of Rabsake.
2Kgs.19.1	So it came to passe, that when kynge Hezekia hearde it, he rent hys clothes, and put on sacke, and came into the house of the Lorde,
2Kgs.19.2	and sent Eliakim which was the stuard of housholde, and Sobna the Scribe, Ꟶ the elders of the preastes clothed in sacke, to Isay the prophete the sonne of Amoz.
2Kgs.19.3	And they sayde vnto him, thus sayth Hezekia this daye is a daye of tribulacyon and of rebuke and blasphemy. For the chyldren are come to the byrth, and there is no strength to be delyuered.
2Kgs.19.4	Paraduenture the Lorde thy God wyll heare all the wordes of Rabsake, whom the kynge of Assyria his master hath sent, to rayle on the lyuynge God, and to rebuke him with wordes, which the Lorde thy God hath hearde: And lyfte thou vp thy prayer for the remnaunt that are lefte.
2Kgs.19.5	So the seruauntes of kynge Hezekia came to Isay:
2Kgs.19.6	And Isaie sayd vnto them: So shall ye saye to youre master: Thus sayth the Lorde: be not afrayde of the wordes which thou hast heard, with which the younge men of the kynge of Assyria haue rayled on me.
2Kgs.19.7	Beholde, I will put him in another mynde, and he shall heare tydinges, and so returne to hys awne lande: And I will bringe to passe, that he shall fall vpon the swerde euen in his awne lande.
2Kgs.19.8	And Rabsakeh went backe agayne, and founde the kynge of Assyria fyghting agaynst Libna: for he had hearde, howe that he was departed from Lachis.
2Kgs.19.9	And when he hearde men saye of Thirhaka kynge of the blacke Mores: Beholde, he is come out to fyght agaynst the,
2Kgs.19.10	he departed, Ꟶ sent messengers vnto Hezekia sayinge. Thus speake to Hezekia kynge of Iuda, sayinge: let not thy God disceaue the, in whom thou trustest, sayinge: Ierusalem shalt not be delyuered into the hande of the kynge of Assyria.
2Kgs.19.11	Beholde, thou hast heard, what the kynges of Assyria haue done to all landes, howe they haue vtterly destroyed them. And shalt thou escape?
2Kgs.19.12	Haue the Gods of the hethen delyuered them, which myne aunsetries haue destroyed? As Gozan, Ꟶ Haran, Rezeph, Ꟶ the chyldren of Eden which were in Bithlasar?
2Kgs.19.13	where is the kynge of Hamath, and the kyng of Arphad, the kynge of the cytie of Sepharnaim, Ꟶ of Hena Ꟶ Iua?
2Kgs.19.14	So Hezekia receaued the letter of the hande of the messengers, and redd it: And Hezekia went vp into the house of the Lorde, Ꟶ layde it abroade before the Lorde.
2Kgs.19.15	And Hezekia prayed before the Lorde, and sayde: O Lord God of Israel, which dwellest betwene the Cherubs, thou art God alone ouer all the kyngdomes of the erth, thou hast made heauen Ꟶ earth Lord,
2Kgs.19.16	bowe downe thine eare, Ꟶ heare: Open Lorde thyne eyes (I beseche the) Ꟶ se: and heare the wordes of Sennacherib which hath sent thys man to rayle on the lyuynge God.
2Kgs.19.17	Of a truthe Lorde, the kinges of Assyria haue destroyed nacyons and their landes,
2Kgs.19.18	and haue sett fyre on their Gods. For they were no Gods, but the worcke of the handes of man: euen of wood Ꟶ stone. And they destroyed them.
2Kgs.19.19	Nowe therfore, O Lorde oure God, I beseche the, saue thou vs out of hys hande, that all the kyngdomes of the earth maye knowe, that thou onely art the Lorde God.
2Kgs.19.20	And Isay the sonne of Amoz sent to Hezekia, sayinge: thus sayth the Lord God of Israel: that which thou hast prayed me, concernynge Sennacherib kynge of Assyria, I haue hearde it.
2Kgs.19.21	This is therfore the worde that the Lord hath sayde of him: The virgin euen the daughter of Sion hath despysed the, and laughed the to scorne (o thou kynge of Assyria) the daughter of Ierusalem hath shaken her head at the.
2Kgs.19.22	Whom hast thou rayled on, Ꟶ whom hast thou blasphemed? Agaynst whom hast thou exalted thy voyce, and lyfted vp thyne eyes so hye. Euen agaynst the holy of Israel.
2Kgs.19.23	By the hande of thy messengers thou hast rayled on the Lorde and sayde: wt the multitude of my charettes I am come vp to the toppes of the mountaynes, euen alonge by the sydes of Libanon, and I wyll cut downe the hye Cedar trees and the lustie fyrre trees therof: and I will go into the lodging of his nest, Ꟶ into the wood of his playne.
2Kgs.19.24	I haue digged Ꟶ droncke straunge waters, and wt the steppe of my goynge will I drye all the water poles that are beseaged.
2Kgs.19.25	Hast thou not hearde, howe I haue ordeyned soch a thinge a great whyle a goo, Ꟶ haue prepared it from the begynninge? And shall I not nowe bringe it forth, that it maye destroye, and to brynge stronge cyties into wast heapes of stones?
2Kgs.19.26	And the enhabiters of them shalbe of lytle power, Ꟶ faynt herted, and confounded, and shalbe lyke the grasse of the felde, or grene herbe, or as the heye on the toppes of the houses: or as the corne that is vnripe, Ꟶ smytten wt blastinge.
2Kgs.19.27	I knowe thy dwellinge, thy commynge out, and thy goynge in, Ꟶ thy furye agaynst me.
2Kgs.19.28	And because thou ragest agaynst me, and thynckest thy selfe so blessed: this is come vp vnto myne earis, Ꟶ I will put my hoke in thy nastrels, and my bytt in thy lyppes, and will bringe the backe agayne, the same waye thou camest.
2Kgs.19.29	And this shalbe a sygne vnto the (O Hezekia) Ye shall eate this yere of soch thynges as growe of them selues, and the next yeare soch as come vp of those that dyd growe of their awne accorde. And the thirde yere sowe ye and reape, plant vyneyardes and eate the frutes therof.
2Kgs.19.30	And it that is escaped Ꟶ lefte, of the daughter of Iuda, shall yet agayne take rotinge downe warde and beare frute vpwarde.
2Kgs.19.31	For out of Ierusalem shall go a remnaunt, and a nombre that shall escape out of mount Sion: the zele of the Lorde of Hostes shall brynge thys thynge to passe.
2Kgs.19.32	Wherfore, thus sayth the Lorde, concerninge the kinge of Assyria: he shall not come to this cytie, nor shote an arowe into it, nor come before it with shilde, nor cast bancke agaynst it:
2Kgs.19.33	but shall go backe agayne the waye he came, Ꟶ shall not come into this cytie sayeth the Lorde.
2Kgs.19.34	For I will defende this cytie, to saue it, for myne awne sake, and for Dauid my seruauntes sake.
2Kgs.19.35	And so it came to passe that the selfe same nyght the angell of the Lorde went out Ꟶ smote in the Hoste of the Assyrians an hundred foure skore and fyue thousande. And when the remnaunt were vp erlye in the mornynge: they sawe, they were all deed coarsses.
2Kgs.19.36	And so Sennacherib kynge of Assyria auoyded and departed, and went agayne, Ꟶ dwelt at Niniue.
2Kgs.19.37	And it fortuned, that as he was in a temple worshyppynge Nisroch hys God, Adramelech Ꟶ Sacesar his awne sonnes smote hym with the swerde. And they escaped into the lande of Armenia, and Asarhaddon his sonne raygned in his steade.
2Kgs.20.1	About that tyme was Hezekia sycke vnto the deeth. And the prophete Isay the sonne of Amoz came to him, and sayde vnto hym. Thus sayth the Lorde: put thyne housholde in an ordre, for thou shalte die, and not lyue.
2Kgs.20.2	And Hezekia turned his face to the wall, Ꟶ prayed vnto the Lorde, sayenge:
2Kgs.20.3	I beseche the nowe, O Lorde, remembre howe I haue walked before the in trueth and with a perfecte herte, and haue done that which is good in thy syght, and Hezekia wepte sore.
2Kgs.20.4	And it fortuned that afore Isay was gone out into the myddle of the courte, the worde of the Lorde came to him, sayinge:
2Kgs.20.5	turne agayne, and tell Hezekia the captayne of my people: Thus sayth the Lorde God of Dauid thy father: I haue herde thy prayer, and sene thy teares. And beholde, I wyll heale the, so that on the thyrde daye thou shalt go vp into the house of the Lorde.
2Kgs.20.6	And I wyll adde vnto thy dayes yet fyftene yere, and will delyuer the and this cytie out of the hande of the kynge of Assyria, and wyll defende thys cytie for myne awne sake, and for Dauid my seruauntes sake.
2Kgs.20.7	And Isay sayde. Take a lompe of fygges. And they toke and layed it on the sore, and he recouered.
2Kgs.20.8	And Hezekia sayde vnto Isay what shalbe the signe, that the Lorde wyll heale me, and that I shall go vp into the house of the Lord the thyrde daye?
2Kgs.20.9	Isay answered: thys sygne shalt thou haue of the Lorde, that the Lorde will do that he hath spoken. Shall the shadowe go forwarde ten degrees, or go backe agayne ten degrees?
2Kgs.20.10	Hezekia answered it is a lyght thynge for the shadowe to go downe ten degrees. but yf the shadow go backewarde ten degrees, it is no lyght thynge.
2Kgs.20.11	And Isay the prophete called vnto the Lorde, and he brought the shadow ten degrees backwarde by which it had gone downe in the dyall of Ahaz.
2Kgs.20.12	The same ceason Berodach Baladan the sonne of Baladan kynge of Babilon sent letters and a present vnto Hezekia, for he had hearde, howe that Hezekia was sycke.
2Kgs.20.13	And Hezekia was glad of them, and shewed them all hys treasure house syluer, golde, odoures, preciouse oyntmente, all the house of hys armorye, and all that was founde in hys treasures: there was nothinge in hys house, Ꟶ in all his realme, that Hezekia shewed them not.
2Kgs.20.14	And Isay the prophete came vnto kynge Hezekia, and sayde vnto hym. What sayed these men, and from whence came they to the? And Hezekia sayde: they be come from a farre countree, euen from Babilon.
2Kgs.20.15	And he sayde agayne: what haue they sene in thy house? Hezekia answered: all the thynges that are in my house haue they sene: there is nothynge amonge my treasures, that I haue not shewed them.
2Kgs.20.16	And Isay sayde vnto Hezekia: heare the worde of the Lorde:
2Kgs.20.17	Beholde, the dayes come, that all that is in thy house, and whatsoeuer thy fathers haue layde vp in store vnto thys daye shalbe caryed into Babylon, and nothynge shalbe lefte sayth the Lorde.
2Kgs.20.18	And of thy sonnes (that shall proceade oute of the, and which thou shalt begette) shall they take awaye, and they shalbe chambrelayns in the palayce of the king of Babilon.
2Kgs.20.19	And Hezekia sayde vnto Isay: wellcome be the worde of the Lorde which thou hast spoken: And he sayde: shall ther not be peace and truthe in my dayes?
2Kgs.20.20	The remnaunt of the wordes that concerne Hezekia, and all hys power, and howe he made a pole and a conduyte, and brought water into the cytie, are they not written in the boke of the Chronicles of the kynges of Iuda?
2Kgs.20.21	And Hezekia slepte wt his fathers, and Manasse hys sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.21.1	Manasse was twelue yere olde, when he beganne to raygne and raygned fyfty Ꟶ fyue yere in Ierusalem: hys mothers name also was Hephziba.
2Kgs.21.2	And he dyd euell in the syght of the Lorde, euen after the abhominacyons of the Hethen whom the Lorde cast out before the chyldren of Israel.
2Kgs.21.3	For he went and buylt vp the hyllaulters, which Hezekia hys father had destroyed. And he reared vp aulters for Baal, and made Idoll groues (as dyd Ahab kynge of Israel,) and worshypped all the Hoste of heauen, and serued them.
2Kgs.21.4	And he buylt aulters in the house of the Lorde, of which the Lorde sayde: in Ierusalem wyll I put my name.
2Kgs.21.5	And he buylt aulters for all the Host of heauen, euen in two courtes of the house of the Lorde.
2Kgs.21.6	And he offered hys sonnes in fyre, and gaue hede vnto witchcraft and sorcery, and mayntened workers with spretes, and tellers of fortunes: and brought moche wyckednesse in the syght of the Lorde to angre hym.
2Kgs.21.7	And he put an ymage of a groue (that he had made) euen in the temple, of which the Lorde had sayde to Dauid and to Salomon his sonne, in thys house and in Ierusalem (which I haue chosen out of all trybes of Israel) wyll I put my name for euer.
2Kgs.21.8	Nether will I make the fete of Israel moue any moare out of the lande, which I gaue theyr fathers: so that they wyll obserue and do all that I haue commaunded them, and accordynge to all the lawe that my seruaunt Moses commaunded them.
2Kgs.21.9	But they herkened not: and Manasse ledd them out of the waye to do more wyckedlye then dyd the hethen people, whom the Lord destroyed before the chyldren of Israel.
2Kgs.21.10	And the Lorde spake by his seruauntes the prophetes, sayinge:
2Kgs.21.11	because Manasse kynge of Iuda hath done soche abhominacions, and hath wrought more wyckedlye then all that the Amorites (which were before hym) dyd: Ꟶ hath made Iuda synne also with hys Idoles.
2Kgs.21.12	Therfore thus sayth the Lorde God of Israel. Beholde, I wyll brynge soche euell vpon Ierusalem and Iuda, that who so heareth of it both his eares shall tyngle.
2Kgs.21.13	And I wyll stretch ouer Ierusalem the squaryng lyne of Samaria, and the plommeth of the house of Ahab. And I wyll wype out Ierusalem, as a man wypeth a disshe, and when he hath wyped it, turneth it vp syde downe.
2Kgs.21.14	And I wyll leaue the remnaunt of myne enheritaunce, and delyuer them into the hande of theyr enemies, and they shalbe robbed and spoyled of all their aduersaries:
2Kgs.21.15	euen because they haue done euell in my syght, Ꟶ haue angred me, sence the tyme theyr fathers came out of Egypte vnto this daye.
2Kgs.21.16	And Manasse shedd innocent bloude exceadynge moche, tyll he replenisshed Ierusalem from corner to corner, besyde hys synne wherwith he made Iuda to synne, and to do euell in the syght of the Lorde.
2Kgs.21.17	The rest of the wordes that concerne Manasse, and all that he dyd, and hys synne that he synned, are they not written in the boke of the chronicles of the kynges of Iuda?
2Kgs.21.18	And Manasse slepte with hys fathers, and was buryed in his awne house, euen in the garden of Uza: Ꟶ Amon his sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.21.19	Amon was .xxii. yeare olde when he beganne to raygne, and he raygned two yeare in Ierusalem. Hys mothers name also was Mesulemeth the daughter of Harum of Iotba.
2Kgs.21.20	And he did euell in the syght of the Lorde (as his father Manasse dyd,)
2Kgs.21.21	and walked in all the waye that his father walked in: Ꟶ serued the ydoles that his father serued, Ꟶ worshypped them.
2Kgs.21.22	And he forsoke the Lorde God of hys fathers, Ꟶ walked not in the waye of the Lorde.
2Kgs.21.23	And the seruauntes of Amon conspyred agaynst hym, and slue the kyng in hys awne house.
2Kgs.21.24	And the people of the lande slue all them that had conspyred agaynst kynge Amon, Ꟶ the people made Iosia hys sonne kynge, in hys steade.
2Kgs.21.25	The rest of the wordes that concerne Amon, what thynges he dyd, are they not wrytten in the boke of the chronicles of the kynges of Iuda?
2Kgs.21.26	And they buryed hym in hys sepulchre, in the garden of Uza: Ꟶ Iosia hys sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.22.1	Iosia was eyght yere olde when he beganne to raygne, and he raygned .xxxi. yere in Ierusalem. His mothers name also was Iedida the daughter of Adaia of Bozcath.
2Kgs.22.2	He dyd that which is ryght in the syght of the Lorde, and walked in all the wayes of Dauid his father, and bowed nether to the ryght hande or to the lefte.
2Kgs.22.3	And it came to passe, that in the .xviii. yeare of the raygne of kynge Iosia, the kynge sent Saphan the sonne of Azalia the sonne of Mesulam the scribe, to the house of the Lorde, sayenge:
2Kgs.22.4	go vp to Helkia the hye Preast, that he maye somme the syluer which is brought into the house of the Lorde, which the kepers of the porche haue gathered of the people,
2Kgs.22.5	and let them delyuer it into the hande of them that do the worcke, and that haue the ouersyght of the house of the Lorde: and let them geue it to them that worke in the house of the Lorde (to repayre the decayed places of the temple,)
2Kgs.22.6	euen vnto carpenters Ꟶ masons, and workers vpon the walles, and for to bye tymbre and fre stone to repayre the temple.
2Kgs.22.7	Howbeit, let no rekonynge be made with them of the moneye that is delyuered into their hande, for their vse is to deale faithfully.
2Kgs.22.8	And Helkia the hye preste sayd vnto Saphan the scribe: I haue founde the boke of the lawe in the housse of the Lorde, and Helkia gaue the boke to Saphan, and he red in it.
2Kgs.22.9	And Saphan the scrybe came to the kynge, and brought him worde agayne, and sayde: thy seruauntes haue bestowed the money (that was founde in the temple) Ꟶ haue delyuered it vnto them that do the worke, Ꟶ that haue the ouersyght of the house of the Lorde.
2Kgs.22.10	And Saphan the scrybe shewed the kynge, sayeng: Helkia the preaste hath delyuered me a boke. And Saphan red in it before the kynge.
2Kgs.22.11	And it fortuned, that whan the kynge had hearde the wordes of the boke of the lawe, he rent his clothes.
2Kgs.22.12	And the kyng commaunded Helkia the Preast, Ꟶ Ahikam the sonne of Saphan, and Achbor the sonne of Michaia, and Saphan the scrybe, and Asahia a seruaunt of the kynges, sayenge:
2Kgs.22.13	go ye and enquyre of the Lorde for me and for the people, and for all Iuda, concernynge the wordes of thys boke that is founde. For great is the wrath of the Lorde that is kendled agaynst vs, because oure fathers haue not herkened vnto the wordes of thys boke, to do accordinge vnto all that which is written therin for vs.
2Kgs.22.14	So Helkia the hye preaste and Akikam, Achbor, and Saphan, and Asahia went vnto Hulda the prophetisse the wyfe of Sullam the sonne of Thikua the sonne of Harham keper of the wardrope: whyche prophetisse dwelt in Ierusalem in the house of the doctrine, and they commoned with her.
2Kgs.22.15	And she answered them: thus sayth the Lord God of Israel. Tell the man that sent you to me:
2Kgs.22.16	thus sayth the Lord: beholde, I wyll brynge euell vpon thys place, and on the inhabiters therof. (euen all the wordes of the boke which the kynge of Iuda hath red)
2Kgs.22.17	because they haue forsaken me, and haue burnt incense vnto other Gods, to angre me with all the workes of theyr handes: My wrath also shalbe kyndled agaynst thys place, and shall not be quenched.
2Kgs.22.18	But to the kynge of Iuda (which sent you to aske councell of the Lorde,) so shall ye saye: thus sayth the Lorde God of Israel as touchynge the wordes which ye haue heard:
2Kgs.22.19	Because thyne herte dyd melt, and because thou hast humbled thy selfe before me the Lorde, when thou heardest what I spake agaynst thys place, and agaynst the enhabiters of the same (howe that they shulde be destroyed and acursed:) and hast rent thy clothes and wepte before me: of that also haue I hearde, sayth the Lorde.
2Kgs.22.20	Beholde therfore, I wyll receaue the vnto thy fathers, and thou shalt be put into thy graue in peace, and thyne eyes shall not se all the euell, which I wyll bringe vpon this place. And they brought the kyng worde agayne.
2Kgs.23.1	And then the kynge sent, and there gathered vnto hym all the elders of Iuda and of Ierusalem.
2Kgs.23.2	And the kyng went vp into the house of the Lorde, with all the men of Iuda and all the enhabitoures of Ierusalem, with the preastes, and prophetes and all the people both small and greate. And he red in the eares of them all the wordes of the boke of the couenaunt, which was founde in the house of the Lorde.
2Kgs.23.3	And the kynge stode by a pyler and made a couenaunt before the Lorde, that they shulde walke after the Lord, and kepe his commaundmentes, hys wytnesses, Ꟶ hys statutes with all theyr herte, and all theyr soule, and make good the wordes of the sayde appoyntment that were wrytten in the forsayde boke. And all the people consented to the appoyntment.
2Kgs.23.4	And the kynge commaunded Helkia the hye preaste, and the inferioure preastes and the kepers of the ornamentes, to brynge out of the temple of the Lorde, all the vesselles that were made for Baal, for the Idole groues Ꟶ for all the Hoste of heauen. And he burnt them without Ierusalem in the feldes of Cedron, and caryed the asshes of them into Bethel.
2Kgs.23.5	And he put downe the ministers of Baal whom the kynges of Iuda had founded to burne incense in the hyllaulters and cyties of Iuda, that were rounde aboute Ierusalem, and also them that burnt incense vnto Baal, to the sonne, to the mone, to the planetes, and to all the Hoste of heauen.
2Kgs.23.6	And he brought out the groue from the temple of the Lorde without Ierusalem vnto the broke Cedron, and burnt it there at the broke Cedron, and stampte it to pouldre, and cast the duste therof vpon the graues of the chyldren of the people.
2Kgs.23.7	And he brake downe the celles of the male stues that were by the house of the Lorde, where the wemen woue hangynges for the Idole groue.
2Kgs.23.8	And he brought all the preastes out of the cyties of Iuda, and defyled the hyllaulters, where the preastes had burnt incense: euen from Geba to Beerseba, and destroied the aulters of the Gates, that were in the enterynge in of the gate of Iosua the gouernoure of the citie which were (as a man goeth in) on the lefte hande of the gate of the cytie.
2Kgs.23.9	Neuerthelesse the preastes of the hyllaultares came not vp to the aulter of the Lorde in Ierusalem, saue onlye they dyd eate of the swete breade among theyr brethren.
2Kgs.23.10	And he defyled Topheth, which is in the valeye of the chyldren of Hinnom, because no man shulde offer hys sonne or hys daughter in fyre to Molech:
2Kgs.23.11	he put downe the horses that the kynges of Israel had geuen to the sonne at the entrynge in of the house of the Lorde, by the chambre of Nathanmelech the chamberlaine which was ruler of the suburbes, and burnt the charettes of the sonne with fyre.
2Kgs.23.12	And the aulters that were on the toppe of the parloure of Ahaz (which the kynges of Iuda had made) and the aulters which Manasse had made in the two courtes of the house of the Lorde, dyd the kynge breake downe, and ranne thence, and cast the dust of them into the broke Cedron.
2Kgs.23.13	And the hyllaulters that were before Ierusalem on the ryght hande of the mounte Oliuete (which Salomon the kynge of Israel had buylded for Astaroth the Idoll of the zidons, and for Chamos the Idoll of the Moabites, and for Milchom the abhomynable Idoll of the children of Ammon) those the kinge defyled:
2Kgs.23.14	and brake the ymages, and cut downe the Idoll groues, and fylled theyr places with the bones of men.
2Kgs.23.15	Moreouer the aulter that was at Bethel, the hyllaulter made by Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat (which made Israel synne) bothe the aulter and also the hyll, he brake downe and burnt the hyll alter and stampte it to powder, and burnt the Idole groue.
2Kgs.23.16	And as Iosia turned hym selfe, he spyed the graues that were in the mount, and sent and fett the bones out of the graues, and burnt them vpon the aulter, to polute it, accordynge to the worde of the Lord that the man of God proclaymed which tolde the same wordes.
2Kgs.23.17	Then he sayde: what graue stone is younder that I se? And the men of the cytie tolde hym, it is the sepulchre of the man of God, whych came from Iuda, and tolde the selfe same thynges that thou hast done to the aulter of Bethel.
2Kgs.23.18	And he sayd let hym be: se that no man moue hys bones. And so hys bones were saued with the bones of a prophete that came out of Samaria.
2Kgs.23.19	And all the houses of the hyllaulters in the cyties of Samaria which the kynges of Israel had made, to angre withall: those Iosia put out of the waye, and dyd to them according to all the actes that he had done in Bethel.
2Kgs.23.20	And he sacrifyced all the preastes of the hylaulters that were ther euen vpon the aulters, and burnt mennes bones vpon them, and returned to Ierusalem.
2Kgs.23.21	And the kynge commaunded all the people, sayeng: kepe the feast of passeouer vnto the Lorde youre God as it is wrytten in the boke of thys couenaunt.
2Kgs.23.22	There was no Passeouer holden lyke that, from the dayes of the iudges that iudged Israel, and in all the dayes of the kynges of Israel and of the kynges of Iuda.
2Kgs.23.23	In the .xviii. yere of kynge Iosia was this Passouer holden to the Lorde in Ierusalem.
2Kgs.23.24	And therto workers with spretes, Ꟶ sothsayers, ymages, ydoles, and all the abhominacyons that were spyed in the lande of Iuda and in Ierusalem, those did Iosia put out of the waye, to perfourme the wordes of the lawe, which were wrytten in the boke, that Helkia the preaste founde in the house of the Lorde:
2Kgs.23.25	lyke vnto him was there no kyng before hym, that turned to the Lorde with all hys herte, with all his soule Ꟶ all hys myght accordynge to all the lawe of Moses, nether after hym arose there any soche as he.
2Kgs.23.26	Not withstandinge the Lorde turned not from the fearcenesse of hys great wrath (wherwith he was angrie agaynst Iuda) because of all the prouocacions that Manasse had prouoked hym withall.
2Kgs.23.27	And the Lorde sayde: I wyll put Iuda also, out of my syght, as I haue done awaye Israel, and wyll cast of thys cytie Ierusalem which I haue chosen, and the house of whyche I sayde: my name shalbe there.
2Kgs.23.28	The rest of the wordes that concerne Iosia and all that he dyd, are they not wrytten in the boke of the Chronycles of the kynges of Iuda?
2Kgs.23.29	In hys dayes Pharao Necho kyng of Egypte went vp agaynst the kynge of Assyria to the ryuer of Euphrates. And kynge Iosia went agaynst hym, and was slayne of hym at Magiddo, when he had sene hym.
2Kgs.23.30	And hys seruauntes caryed hym deed from Magiddo, and brought hym to Ierusalem Ꟶ buryed hym in hys awne sepulchre. And the people of the lande toke Iehoahaz the sonne of Iosia, and anoynted hym, and made hym kynge in hys fathers steade.
2Kgs.23.31	Iehoahaz was .xxiii. yere olde when he beganne to raygne, and raygned thre monethes in Ierusalem. Hys mothers name also was Hamiel the daughter of Ieremia of Libna.
2Kgs.23.32	And he dyd euell in the syght of the Lorde, accordinge to all thynges as his fathers had done.
2Kgs.23.33	And Pharao Necho put hym in bondes at Ribla in the lande of Hamath that he shulde not raygne in Ierusalem, and put the lande to a trybute of an hundred talentes of syluer and a talent of golde.
2Kgs.23.34	And Pharao Necho made Eliakim the sonne of Iosia kyng in the rowme of Iosia his father, and turned hys name to Iehoakim, and toke Iehoahaz awaye, whych when he came to Egypte, dyed there.
2Kgs.23.35	And Iehoakim gaue the syluer and the golde to Pharao: Ꟶ taxed the lande, to geue the moneye accordinge to the request of Pharao: requyringe of euery man (accordynge to theyr abylite) syluer and golde: euen of the people of the lande, to geue vnto Pharao Necho.
2Kgs.23.36	Iehoakim was .xxv. yere olde when he beganne to raygne, and he raygned a .xi. yere in Ierusalem. Hys mothers name also was zebuda the daughter of Pedaia of Ruma.
2Kgs.23.37	And he dyd that which was euell in the syght of the Lorde, accordynge to all thinge as his fathers had done.
2Kgs.24.1	In hys dayes came Nabuchodonosor kynge of Babylon vp, and Iehoakim became hys seruaunt thre yere, and then turned, and rebelled agaynst hym.
2Kgs.24.2	And the Lorde sent vpon him men of warre from amonge the Caldeys, from amonge the Syrians, out of the Moabites, and from the chyldren of Ammon: and sent them agaynst Iuda, to destroye it, accordynge to the sayinge of the Lorde, which he spake by hys seruauntes the prophetes.
2Kgs.24.3	Onely, at the byddynge of the Lorde happened it so to Iuda, to put them out of his syght, for the synnes of Manasse, accordynge to all that he dyd:
2Kgs.24.4	and for the innocent bloude that he shed, and fylled Ierusalem with innocent bloude: and the Lorde wolde not be reconcyled.
2Kgs.24.5	The rest of the wordes that concerne Iehoakim, Ꟶ all that he dyd, are they not written in the boke of the chronycles of the kynges of Iuda?
2Kgs.24.6	And so Iehoakim slepte wt hys fathers: and Iehoachin hys sonne raygned in hys steade.
2Kgs.24.7	And the kynge of Egipt came nomore out of his lande: for the kynge of Babylon had taken from the ryuer of Egipt vnto the ryuer of Euphrates, all that pertayned to the kynge of Egipte.
2Kgs.24.8	Iehoachin was .xviij. yere olde, Ꟶ raygned in Ierusalem thre monethes. His mothers name also was Nehusta, the daughter of Elnathan of Ierusalem.
2Kgs.24.9	And he dyd that which was euell in the sight of the Lorde, according to all as hys father had done.
2Kgs.24.10	In that tyme came the seruauntes of Nabuchadnezar kyng of Babilon vp against Ierusalem, Ꟶ the citye was beseged.
2Kgs.24.11	And Nabuchadnezar the king of Babylon came agaynst the citye: Ꟶ his seruauntes dyd besege it.
2Kgs.24.12	And Iehoachin the kyng of Iuda came out to the kynge of Babylon he and hys mother, hys seruauntes, hys lordes, and hys chamberlaynes. And the kyng of Babilon toke him, in the eyght yere of hys raygne.
2Kgs.24.13	And he caryed out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lorde, Ꟶ the treasure of the kynges house: and brake all the vessels of golde, which Salomon kynge of Israel had made in the temple of the Lorde, as the Lorde had sayde.
2Kgs.24.14	And he caryed awaye all Ierusalem, and all the lordes, and all the strong men of warre, euen .x.M. into captiuite: and all craftes men and kepers, none remayning saue the poore commen people of the lande.
2Kgs.24.15	And he caryed awaye Iehoachin to Babylon, and the kynges mother, and the kynges wyues, his chamberlayns, and them that were myghty in the lande: those caryed he awaye into captiuyte from Ierusalem to Babilon.
2Kgs.24.16	And all the actiue men of warre, euen .vij.M. and craftesmen, and porters .M. all that were stronge and apte for warre, dyd the kinge of Babilon bryng to Babilon captyue.
2Kgs.24.17	And the kynge of Babylon made Mathania hys fathers brother, kynge in his steade, Ꟶ chaunged hys name to zedekia.
2Kgs.24.18	zedekia was .xxj. yere olde when he beganne to raygne, and he raygned eleuen yere in Ierusalem. Hys mothers name also was Hamital the daughter of Ieremia of Libna.
2Kgs.24.19	And he dyd euell in the syght of the Lord, accordynge to all as Ichoachin had done.
2Kgs.24.20	For the wrath of the Lorde was moued agaynst Ierusalem and Iuda, vntyll he cast them out of hys syght. And zedekia rebelled agaynst the kynge of Babylon.
2Kgs.25.1	And it fortuned, that in the nynth yere of hys raygne, the tenth daye of the tenth moneth: Nebuchadnezar kynge of Babilon came, he and all his hoost agaynst Ierusalem: and pitched agaynst it, and made engynes agaynst it on euery syde.
2Kgs.25.2	And the citye was beseged vnto the eleuenth yere of kinge zedekia.
2Kgs.25.3	And the nynth daye of the moneth, there was so greate hongre in the citye, that there was no breed for the people of the lande.
2Kgs.25.4	And the citye was broken vp: and all the men of armes fledd by nyght, by a waye thorowe a gate which is betwene two walles, by the kynges garden: the Chaldees lyinge about the citye. And the kynge went the waye towarde the playne.
2Kgs.25.5	And the soudyers of the Chaldees folowed after the kynge, and toke him in the playne of Iericho, and all hys armye were scatered awaye from hym,
2Kgs.25.6	So they toke the kynge, and brought hym to Nebuchadnezar the kynge of Babylon to Ribla, where they reasoned wt hym.
2Kgs.25.7	And they slue the sonnes of zedekia before hys eyes: and he put out the eyes of zedekia, and fettered him with two chaynes, and caryed hym to Babylon.
2Kgs.25.8	And the .vij. daye of the .v. moneth which is the .xix. yere of king Nabuchadnezer king of Babylon, came Nebusaradan a seruaunt of the kynge of Babylon, and chefe captayne of the men of warre, vnto Ierusalem:
2Kgs.25.9	Ꟶ burnt the house of the Lorde, and the kynges house, and all the houses of Ierusalem, Ꟶ all great houses burnt he wt fyre.
2Kgs.25.10	And all the soudiers of the Chaldees that were with the chefe captayne of the men of warre, broke downe the walles of Ierusalem rounde about.
2Kgs.25.11	But the rest of the people that were left in the citye, and them that were fledd to the kyng of Babylon, wt the remnaunt of the comen people, dyd Nabusaradan the chefe captayne of the men of warre carye awaye:
2Kgs.25.12	but the captayne of the souldyers lefte of the poore of the lande, to dresse the vynes, and to tyll the grounde.
2Kgs.25.13	And the pyllers of brasse that were in the house of the Lord, and the sockettes, and the brasen lauatory that was in the house of the Lorde dyd the Chaldees breake, and caryed all the brasse of them to Babylon.
2Kgs.25.14	And the pottes, shouelles, dressynge knyues, spones, and all the vessels of brasse that they minystred in, toke they awaye.
2Kgs.25.15	And the fyer pannes, and basens, and soch thinges as were of golde, Ꟶ of siluer,
2Kgs.25.16	then toke the chefe captayne awaye: euen two pyllers, one lauatory, and the sokettes which Salomon had made for the house of the Lord. The brasse of all these vesselles was without waight.
2Kgs.25.17	The heygth of the one pyller was .xviij. cubytes, and the heed theron was brasse, and thre cubytes hye and vpon the heed was there a wrethen worke and pomegranates rounde aboute, all of brasse. And of the same fassyon was the seconde pyller, with a wrethen worke.
2Kgs.25.18	And the chefe captayne of the men of warre toke Saraia the chefe preste, and zephoniah the hyest preste saue one, and the thre kepers of the holy thynges.
2Kgs.25.19	And out of the citye he toke a chamberlayne, that had the ouersight of the men of warre, and .v. men of them that were euer in the kynges presence, which were founde in the cytie: and him that was scrybe to the captayne of the hoost, which brought out the people of the lande to warre, and thre skore men of the people of the lande, that were founde in the citye.
2Kgs.25.20	And Nebusaradan the chefe captayne of the men of warre toke these, and brought them to the kynge of Babylon to Ribla.
2Kgs.25.21	And the kynge of Babylon smote them, and slue them at Ribla in the hande of Hanath. And so Iuda was caryed awaye out of theyr lande.
2Kgs.25.22	Howebeit, there remayned people in the lande of Iuda, whom Nebuchadnezar kyng of Babylon lefte, Ꟶ made Gedalia the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Saphan ruler ouer them.
2Kgs.25.23	And all the captaynes of the souldyers, and other men hearde, that the kynge of Babilon had made Gedalia gouerner: and there came to Gedalia to Mazphah: Ismael the sonne of Nethania, Iohannan the sonne of Karea, Saraia the sonne of Thanhumeth the Netophathite, and Iazaania the sonne of Maachati, Ꟶ theyr men.
2Kgs.25.24	And Gedalia sware to them and to the men whom they had with them, and sayde vnto them: feare not ye because ye are the seruauntes of the caldees, dwell in the lande, and serue the kinge of Babilon, and ye shalbe well.
2Kgs.25.25	But it chaunced in the seuenth moneth, that Ismael the sonne of Nethania the sonne of Elisama, of the kynges bloude, came, and ten men with hym, and smote Gedalia, that he dyed: and so dyd he the Iewes and the Chaldees that were with hym at Mizpa.
2Kgs.25.26	And all the people, bothe small and greate, and the captaynes of warre arose, and came to Egipte: for they were afrayd of the Chaldees.
2Kgs.25.27	Notwithstandyng yet in the seuen and thyrtye yere after Iehoachin kynge of Iuda was caryed awaye the seuen and twentye daye of the twelueth moneth, Euilmerodach kynge of Babylon, the same yeare that he beganne to raygne, dyd lyfte vp the heade of Iehoachin kynge of Iuda out of the preson,

2Kgs.25.29	and chaunged hys preson garmentes. And he dyd euer eate breed before hym, all the dayes of hys lyfe.
