1Chr.16.1	So they brought in the arcke of God and set it in the myddes of the tent that Dauid pytched for it. And they offered burnt sacrifyces and peace offerynges before God.
1Chr.16.2	And when Dauid had made an ende of offerynge the burnt offerynges and peace offerynges, he blessed the people in the name of the Lorde.
1Chr.16.3	And he dealt to all Israel (both man Ꟶ woman) a cracknell of breade, and a good pece of flesshe, and a flacket of wyne.

1Chr.16.25	For greate is the Lorde, and worthy to be praysed exceadyngly: he is to be feared aboue all Gods.
1Chr.16.26	For all the Gods of the people are of no value: But the Lorde made heauen.
1Chr.16.27	Prayse and honoure are in hys presence: strength and gladnes are in hys place.

1Chr.16.43	And all the people departed, euery man to hys house: and Dauid returned to blesse hys house.
1Chr.17.1	And it fortuned that whan Dauid dwelt in hys house, he sayde to Nathan the prophete: lo, I dwell in an house of Cedar tree: but the Arcke of the Lordes couenaunt remayneth vnder curtaynes.
1Chr.17.2	And Nathan sayd to Dauid: do all that is in thyne herte, for God is with the.
1Chr.17.3	And the same nyght it fortuned that the worde of God came to Nathan, sayinge:
1Chr.17.4	go and tell Dauid my seruaunt, thus sayth the Lorde, thou shalt not buylde me an house to dwell in.
1Chr.17.5	For I haue dwelt in no house sence the daye that I brought out the chyldren of Israel vnto thys daye: but haue gone from tent to tent, and from one habitacyon to another.
1Chr.17.6	And whersoeuer I haue walked wyth all Israel, spake I euer one worde to anye of the iudges of Israell (whom I commaunded to fede my people,) sayinge: why haue ye not buylt me an house of Cedar tree?
1Chr.17.7	Nowe therfore, thus shalt thou saye vnto my seruaunt Dauid: thus sayth the Lorde of Hostes: I toke the out of the pastures whan thou wentest after shepe, that thou shuldest be captayne ouer my people Israel.
1Chr.17.8	And I haue bene wt the whither soeuer thou hast walked, Ꟶ haue weded out all thyne enemyes out of thy sight Ꟶ haue made the a name, lyke the name of the greatest men that are in the erthe.
1Chr.17.9	And I haue ordeyned a place for my people Israel and made it faste, so that nowe they maye dwell in theyr place, and moue nomore. Nether shall the chyldren of wyckednesse vexe them any moare as at the begynnynge.
1Chr.17.10	And sense the tyme that I commaunded iudges to be ouer my people Israel, I haue subdued all thyne enemies, and I tolde the, that the Lorde wolde buylde the an house.
1Chr.17.11	Thys also shall come to passe: when thy dayes be expired, that thou must go vnto thy fathers, I wyll rayse vp thy sead after the which shalbe of thy sonnes, and I wyll prepare for hym the kyngdome.
1Chr.17.12	He shall buylde me an house, and I wyll stablishe his seate for euer
1Chr.17.13	I wylbe hys father, and he shalbe my sonne, and I wyll not take my mercy awaye from hym, as I toke it from hym that was before the.
1Chr.17.14	But I wyll sett hym in myne house and in my kyngdome for euer, and hys seate shalbe sure for euermore
1Chr.17.15	According to all these wordes, and accordyng to all thys visyon, dyd Nathan tell kinge Dauid.
1Chr.17.16	And Dauid the kynge came Ꟶ sat before the Lorde, Ꟶ sayde: what am I (O Lord God,) and what is mynehoushold, that thou hast promoted me thus farre?
1Chr.17.17	And yet thys semed lyttel in thyne eyes, O God: But thou hast also spoken of thy seruauntes house for a greate whyle to come: and hast loked vpon me as vpon a man of hye degree (O Lorde God.)
1Chr.17.18	What shall Dauid desyre more of the for the honoure of thy seruaunt? For thou hast knowen thy seruaunt:
1Chr.17.19	O Lorde for thy seruauntes sake, euen accordynge to thyne awne hert hast thou done all thys magnifycence, to shewe all great thinges.
1Chr.17.20	Lorde, there is none lyke the, nether is there anye God saue thou, accordinge to all that we haue hearde wt oure eares.
1Chr.17.21	Moreouer, what nacion on the erth is lyke thy people Israel, to whom God hath vouchsafed to come and redeme them to be hys awne people, and to make the a name of excellency and terriblenesse, with castyng out nacyons from before thy people, whom thou hast delyuered out of Egypte?
1Chr.17.22	Thy people of Israel dyddest thou make thyne awne people for euer, and thou becamest theyr God.
1Chr.17.23	Therfore nowe Lorde, let the thynge that thou hast spoken concernynge thy seruaunt and hys house, be true for euer, that thou do as thou hast sayde: let it come to passe,
1Chr.17.24	that thy name maye be magnifyed for euer, that it maye be sayde: the Lorde of Hostes is the God of Israel (euen the God of Israel) Ꟶ the house of Dauid thy seruaunt endureth stable before the.
1Chr.17.25	For thou (O my God) hast tolde thy seruaunte, that thou wylt buylde him an house. And therfore thy seruaunt hath founde in hys hert to praye before the.
1Chr.17.26	And nowe Lord, thou art God, and hast promised thys goodnesse vnto thy seruaunte.
1Chr.17.27	Nowe therfore, let it be thy pleasure to blesse the house of thy seruaunt, that it maye contynue before the for euer. For whom thou blessest (O Lorde) the same is blessed for euer.

1Chr.18.6	and Dauid subdued Syria Damasco: And the Syriens became Dauids seruauntes, Ꟶ brought hym trybute. And the Lorde preserued Dauid in all that he went to.
1Chr.18.7	And Dauid toke the shyldes of golde that were on the seruauntes of Hadadezer, and brought them to Ierusalem.
1Chr.18.8	And from Tebhath Ꟶ from Chun (cyties of Hadarezer) brought Dauid exceadynge moche brasse. Wher wt Salomon made the brasen lauatorye, the pillers, Ꟶ the vesselles of brasse.
1Chr.18.9	And when Tou Kynge of Hemath, heard how Dauid had beaten all the strength of Hadarezer kynge of zoba,
1Chr.18.10	he sent Haduran his sonne to kynge Dauid, to make peace wt hym Ꟶ to blesse hym, because he had fought agaynst Hadarezer, Ꟶ beaten him (for Tou had warre wt Hadarezer) Ꟶ Dauid brought, all maner of Iewelles of golde, syluer and brasse wt hym.
1Chr.18.11	And kynge Dauid dedicated them vnto the Lorde, with the syluer Ꟶ gold that he brought from all nacyons, from Edom, from Moab, from the chyldren of Ammon, from the Philistines, Ꟶ from Amalec.
1Chr.18.12	And Abisai the sonne of zeruia slue of the Edomites in the salte valeye .xviii. thousande,
1Chr.18.13	and put Soudiars in Edom, and all the Edomites became Dauids seruauntes. Thus the Lorde kepte Dauid in all that he toke in hande.
1Chr.18.14	And Dauid raygned ouer all Israel, Ꟶ executed iudgement and ryghteousnes amonge all his people.
1Chr.18.15	And Ioab the sonne of zaruia was ouer the hoste, and Iehosaphat the sonne of Ahilud recorder,
1Chr.18.16	and zadock the sonne of Ahitub and Abimelech the sonne of Abiathar were the preastes, and Sauesa was scribe,
1Chr.18.17	and Banaiahu the sonne of Iehoiada was ouer the Crethites, and the Phelethites, Ꟶ the eldest sonnes of Dauid were nexte vnto the kynge.
1Chr.19.1	After this, it chaunced that Nahas the kynge of the chyldren of Ammon dyed, Ꟶ his sonne raygned in his steade.
1Chr.19.2	And Dauid sayde, I wyll shewe kyndnesse vnto Hanon the sonne of Nahas, because hys father dealt kyndelye with me: And Dauid sent messengers to comforte hym ouer the deeth of hys father. And the seruauntes of Dauid came into the lande of the chyldren of Ammon to Hanon, to comforte hym.
1Chr.19.3	But the Lordes of the chyldren of Ammon sayde to Hanon: thynkest thou that Dauid doth honoure thy father in thy syght, that he hath sent conforters vnto the? Are not hys seruauntes come to searche, to loke, and to spye out the lande?
1Chr.19.4	Wherfore Hanon toke Dauids seruauntes and shaued them, and cut of their cootes harde by their buttokes, and sent them awaye.
1Chr.19.5	And there went certayne and tolde Dauid, howe the men were serued. And the kynge sent to mete them (for the men were exceadynglye ashamed) and the kynge sayde: tarye at Iericho, vntyll youre beardes be growen, and then returne.
1Chr.19.6	And when the chyldren of Ammon sawe that they stanke in the syght of Dauid. Hanon Ꟶ the chyldren of Ammon sent a thousande talentes of syluer to hyre them charettes Ꟶ horsemen, out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha Ꟶ out of zoba.
1Chr.19.7	And they hyred .xxxii. thousande charettes, and the kynge of Maacha Ꟶ his people, which came, and pytched before Meoba. And the chyldren of Ammon gathered them selues togeather from their cyties, Ꟶ came to battel.
1Chr.19.8	And whan Dauid heard of it, he sent Ioab and all the hoste of stronge men.
1Chr.19.9	And the chyldren of Ammon came out, and put them selues in araye to battel before the gate of the cytie. And the kynges that were come, kepte them by them selues backe in the felde.
1Chr.19.10	When Ioab also sawe that the fronte of the battell was agaynst him before Ꟶ behynde, he chose out of all the chosen men of Israel, and put them in araye agaynst the Syrians.
1Chr.19.11	And the rest of the people he delyuered vnto the hande of Abisai his brother, Ꟶ they put them selues in araye agaynst the chyldren of Ammon.
1Chr.19.12	And he sayde: If the Sirians be to strong for me, thou shalt succoure me: Ꟶ yf the chyldren of Ammon preuayle agaynst the, I will helpe the.
1Chr.19.13	Plucke vp thine hert, Ꟶ let vs playe the men, for oure peoples sake Ꟶ for the cyties of oure God, Ꟶ the Lorde shall do that which is good in his awne syght.
1Chr.19.14	So Ioab Ꟶ the people that were wt him, drue nye before the Syrians vnto the battayll, Ꟶ they fled before him.
1Chr.19.15	And when the chyldren of Ammon sawe that the Syriens were fled, they ranne awaye lykewise before Abisai his brother, and gat them into the cytie. And Ioab came to Ierusalem.
1Chr.19.16	And when the Siriens sawe that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers Ꟶ fet out the Siriens that were beyond the ryuer, Ꟶ Sophach the capitayne of the Host of Hadadezer went before them.

1Chr.19.18	But the Siriens fled before Israel. And Dauid destroyed of the Siriens seuen thousande charettes, Ꟶ .xl. thousand fote men, and kylled Sophach the captayne of the hoste.
1Chr.19.19	And when the seruauntes of Hadarezer, sawe, that they were put to the worse before them of Israel, they made peace wt Dauid, Ꟶ became his seruauntes. Nether wolde the Siriens helpe the chyldren of Ammon any more.
1Chr.20.1	And it came to passe, that after the yere was expyred (aboute the tyme that kynges go out a warrefare.) Ioab caryed out the armye of the hoste, and destroyed the contreye of the chyldren of Ammon, Ꟶ came, Ꟶ beseged Rabba, Ꟶ destroyed it: But Dauid taryed at Ierusalem whyle Ioab smote Rabba and destroyed it:
1Chr.20.2	And Dauid toke the croune of their kynge: from of hys heed, Ꟶ founde that it had the wayght of a talent of golde, and there were preciouse stones in it, and it was ordeyned for Dauids heed. And he brought also exceadynge moche spoyle out of the cytie.
1Chr.20.3	And he brought out the people that were in it, and tormented them with sawes and harowes of yron, and with other sharpe instrumentes, and so dealte Dauid with all the cyties of the chyldren of Ammon. And Dauid Ꟶ all the people came agayne to Ierusalem.
1Chr.20.4	After this it fortuned, that there arose warre at Gazer with the Philistines. At which tyme Sobocai the Husathite slue Sippai, that was of the chyldren of Rephaim, and they were subdewed.
1Chr.20.5	And there was battell agayne with the Philistines, and Elhanan the sonne of Iair, slue Lahemi the brother of Goliath the Gethite, whose speare was lyke a weauers beame.
1Chr.20.6	And there chaunced yet agayne warre at Geth, where as was a man of a great stature wt .xxiiii. fyngers, Ꟶ toes .vi. on euery hande, and .vi. on euery fote, Ꟶ was the sonne of Raphah. But whan he defyed Israel,
1Chr.20.7	Iehonathan the sonne of Simea Dauids brother slue hym.
1Chr.20.8	These were borne vnto Raphah at Geth, Ꟶ were ouerthrowen in the hande of Dauid, Ꟶ in the hande of his seruauntes.
1Chr.21.1	And Satan stode vp agaynst Israel, Ꟶ prouoked Dauid to nombre Israel.
1Chr.21.2	And Dauid sayde to Ioab and to the rulers of the people. Go ye and nombre Israel from Beer Seba to Dan, and brynge it to me that I maye know the nombre of them.
1Chr.21.3	And Ioab answered: the Lorde make hys people an hundred tymes so manye mo as they be. But my Lorde O king, are they not all my Lordes seruauntes? why then doth my Lorde requyre thys thynge? why wyll my Lorde be a cause of trespace to Israel?
1Chr.21.4	Neuerthelesse, the kynges worde preuayled agaynst Ioab. And Ioab departed and walked thorowe out all them of Israel, and came to Ierusalem agayne
1Chr.21.5	Ꟶ gaue the nombre of the counte of the people vnto Dauid. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousande Ꟶ an hundred thousande men that drue swerde: and Iuda was .cccc.lxx. thousande men that drue swerd.
1Chr.21.6	But the Leuites and Ben Iamin counted he not amonge them. For the kynges worde was abhominable to Ioab.
1Chr.21.7	And the Lorde was displeased with thys thynge, and smote Israel.
1Chr.21.8	And Dauid sayde vnto God: I haue synned exceadyngly in doynge this thynge. And nowe (I beseche the) do awaye the wyckednesse of thy seruaunt, for I haue done very folyshlye.
1Chr.21.9	And the Lorde spake vnto Gad Dauids sear, sayinge:
1Chr.21.10	goo and tell Dauid, sayinge: Thus sayth the Lorde: I geue the, the choyse of thre thynges: chose the one of them, that I maye do vnto the.
1Chr.21.11	And Gad came to Dauid, and sayde vnto hym. Thus sayth the Lorde. Chose the,
1Chr.21.12	ether thre yeares famyshement, or thre monethes to be destroyed before thyne aduersaryes, and that the swerde of thyne enemyes maye ouertake the: or else the swerde of the Lorde and pestilence in the lande thre dayes, and the Angell of the Lorde destroying thorowe out all the coastes of Israel. And nowe aduise thy selfe, what worde I shall brynge agayne to hym that sent me.
1Chr.21.13	And Dauid sayde vnto Gad. I am in an exceadynge straite: Let me fall nowe into the hande of the Lorde, for passynge great are hys mercyes, but let me not fall into the hand of men.
1Chr.21.14	So the Lorde sent pestilence vpon Israel, and there were ouerthrowen of Israel .lxx. thousande men.
1Chr.21.15	And God sent the Angel into Ierusalem to destroye in it. And as he was about to destroye, the Lord behelde, and had compassyon on the euyll, and sayde to the Angell that destroyed: it is ynough, let now thyne hande ceasse. And the Angell of the Lorde stode by the thresshynge flowre of Ornan the Iebusyte.
1Chr.21.16	And Dauid lyfte vp hys eyes, and sawe the Angell of the Lord stande betwene the erth and heauen, hauynge a drawen swerde in hys hande, stretched out towarde Ierusalem. Then Dauid Ꟶ the elders of Israel whych were clothed in sacke, fell vpon theyr faces.
1Chr.21.17	And Dauid sayd vnto God: Is it not I that commaunded the people to be nombred? It is I that haue synned Ꟶ done euell in dede, Ꟶ what haue these shepe done? let thyne hande (O Lorde my God) be on me and on my fathers house, but not on thy people that they shulde be punysshed.
1Chr.21.18	And the Angell of the Lorde commaunded Gad to saye to Dauid, that Dauid shulde go vp, and set vp an aulter vnto the Lorde, in the thresshynge flowre of Ornan the Iebusyte.
1Chr.21.19	And Dauid went vp accordynge to the sayinge of Gad, which he spake in the name of the Lorde.
1Chr.21.20	And Ornan turned aboute, and sawe the Angell, Ꟶ hys foure sonnes were with hym, and hyd them selues: But Ornan was thresshyng wheat.
1Chr.21.21	And as Dauid came to Ornan, Ornan loked Ꟶ sawe Dauid, and went out of the thresshynge floure, and bowed hym selfe to Dauid wyth his face to the grounde.
1Chr.21.22	And Dauid sayde to Ornan: geue me the place of the thresshyng flowre, that I maye buyld an aulter therin vnto the Lord. Thou shalt geue it me for as moche money as it is worthe, that the plage maye cease from the people.
1Chr.21.23	And Ornan sayde vnto Dauid: take it to the, Ꟶ let my Lord the kyng do that which semeth good in his eyes: loo, I geue the oxen also for burnt sacrifyces, Ꟶ the thresshyng sleades for wodde, Ꟶ wheate for meat offeryng: I geue it all.
1Chr.21.24	And kynge Dauid sayd to Ornan: not so, but I wyll bye it for as moche moneye as it is worth. For I wyll not take that whych is thyne for the Lorde, ner offer burntoffrynges wythout coast.
1Chr.21.25	And so Dauid gaue to Ornan for that place, sycles of gold .vi. hundred by waight.
1Chr.21.26	And Dauid buylt there an aulter vnto the Lord, and offered burntofferynges Ꟶ peaceoffrynges, and called vpon the Lord, and he heard hym from heauen in fyre vpon the aulter of burntoffering.
1Chr.21.27	And whan the Lord had spoken to the Angell, he put vp his swerd agayne into the shethe of it.
1Chr.21.28	At that tyme when Dauid sawe, that the Lorde had hearde hym in the thresshynge flowre of Ornan the Iebusyte: he vsed to offer there.
1Chr.21.29	For the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wildernesse, and the aulter of burntofferynge were at that ceason in the hyll at Gibeon.
1Chr.21.30	And Dauid coulde not go before it to aske councell at God, for he was aferde of the swerde of the Angell of the Lorde.
1Chr.22.1	And Dauid sayde: thys is the house of the Lorde God, and thys is the aultare for the burntofferynge of Israel.
1Chr.22.2	And Dauid commaunded togeather together the straungers that were in the lande of Israel, and he sett masons to hewe fre stone, for the buylding of the house of God.
1Chr.22.3	And Dauid prepared plentie of yron for nayles and dores of the gates, and to ioyne with all, and aboundance of brasse without wayght,
1Chr.22.4	and Cedar trees wythout nombre. For the zidons and they of Tyre brought moch Cedar wood to Dauid.
