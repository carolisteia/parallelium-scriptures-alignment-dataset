Rom.0.0	¶ The Epistle of the Apostle Saynct Paul to the Romayns.
Rom.1.1	Paul the seruaunt of Iesus Chryst called to the office of an Apostle put a parte for the Gospell of God
Rom.1.2	whych he had promysed afore by hys Prophetes in the holy scriptures
Rom.1.3	of hys sonne, whych was borne of the seed of Dauid after the flesshe:
Rom.1.4	and hath bene declared to be the sonne of God wt power, after the sprete that sanctifyeth, sence the tyme that Iesus Chryst oure Lorde rose agayne from deeth
Rom.1.5	by whom we haue receaued grace Ꟶ Apostleshyp, that obedience myght be geuen vnto the fayth in hys name amonge all heathen,
Rom.1.6	of whose nombre you be, the electe of Iesu Chryst.
Rom.1.7	To all you that be at Rome, beloued of God and sayntes by electyon. Grace be wt you and peace from God oure father, Ꟶ from the Lorde Iesus Chryst.
Rom.1.8	Fyrst verely I thanke my God thorow Iesus Chryst for you all, that youre fayth is spoken of in all the worlde.
Rom.1.9	For God is my wytnes (whom I serue. Wyth my sprete in the Gospell of hys sonne) that wythout ceasynge I make mencyon of you prayinge allwayes in my prayers,
Rom.1.10	that by some meane, at the last (one tyme or other) a prospesperous iorney (by the wyll of God) myght fortune me, to come vnto you.
Rom.1.11	For I longe to se you, that I myght bestowe amonge you some spyrituall gyfte, to strength you withall:
Rom.1.12	that is, that I myght haue consolacyon together wyth you, through the commen fayth whych both ye and I haue.
Rom.1.13	I wolde that ye shuld knowe (brethren) how that I haue often tymes purposed to come vnto you but haue bene let hitherto, to haue some frute also amonge you, as among other of the Gentyls.
Rom.1.14	I am detter both to the Grekes and to the vngrekes, to the learned and to the vnlearned.
Rom.1.15	So that (as moch as in me is) I am redy to preach the Gospell to you that are at Rome also.
Rom.1.16	For I am not asshamed of the Gospell of Chryst, because it is the power of God vnto saluacion to euery one that beleueth, to the Iewe fyrst, Ꟶ also to the Gentyle.
Rom.1.17	For by it is the ryghtewesnes of God opened from fayth to fayth.
Rom.1.18	As it is written the iust shall lyue by fayth. For the wrath of God apeareth from heauen agaynst all vngodlynes and vnryghtewesnes of men, whych withholde the trueth in vnrightewesnes:
Rom.1.19	seynge that it whych maye be knowen of God, is manyfest amonge them because God hath shewed it vnto them.
Rom.1.20	For hys inuisyble thinges (that is to saye hys eternall power ad godhed) are sene, for as moch as they are vnderstande by the workes from the creacyon of the worlde: So that they are wythout excuse
Rom.1.21	because that when they knewe God, they glorifyed hym not as God, nether were thankfull but wexed full of vanities in theyr imaginacions, and theyr folysh hert was blynded.
Rom.1.22	When they counted them selues wyse, they became fooles
Rom.1.23	and turned the glory of the immortall God, vnto an ymage, made not onely after the symilitude of a mortall man but also of byrdes, Ꟶ fourefoted beastes Ꟶ of creping beastes.
Rom.1.24	Wherfore, God gaue them vp, to vnclennes, thorow the lustes of their awne heartes to defyle their awne bodyes amonge them selues:
Rom.1.25	whych chaunged hys truthe for a lye. and worshypped and serued the thinges that be made, more than hym that made them, which is to be praysed for euer. Amen.
Rom.1.26	Wherfore, God gaue them vp vnto shamefull lustes: For euen their wemen dyd chaunge the naturall vse in to that whych is agaynst nature.
Rom.1.27	And lyke wyse also the men, lefte the natural vse of the woman, and brent in their lustes one wyth another, men wyth men wrought fylthynes, and receaued to them selues the rewarde of theyr erroure, as it was accordynge.
Rom.1.28	And as they regarded not to knowe God euen so God delyuered them vp vnto a lewde mynde, that they shulde do those thynges whych were not comly,
Rom.1.29	beyng full of all vnryghteousnesse, fornicacyon, wyckednes, coueteousnes, malicyousnes, full of enuye morther, debate, disceyte, euyll condicyoned, whysperers,
Rom.1.30	backbyters, haters of God, dysdaynfull, proude, boasters, bringers vp of euyll thynges, disobedyent to father and mother,
Rom.1.31	wythout vnderstandynge, couenaunte breakers, vnlouynge, trucebreakers, vnmercyfull.
Rom.1.32	Which men, though they knew the ryghtewesnes of God, how that they which commyt soche thynges, are worthy of deeth, not only do the same but also haue pleasure in them that do them.
Rom.2.1	Therfore art thou inexcusable. O man, whosoeuer thou be that iudgest For in that same wherin thou iudgest another thou condemnest thy selfe. For thou that iudgest, doest euen the same selfe thynges.
Rom.2.2	But we are sure, that the iudgement of God is accordynge to trueth, agaynst them whych commyt soch thynges.
Rom.2.3	Thynkest thou thys, O thou man that iudgest them whych do soche thynges, and doest euen the very same thy selfe, that thou shalt escape the iudgement of God?
Rom.2.4	Ether despysest thou the ryches of hys goodnes, and pacyence and longe sufferaunce, not knowyng that the kyndnes of God leadeth the to repentaunce?
Rom.2.5	But thou after thy stubburnesse, and herte that cannot repent, heapest vnto thy selfe wrath agaynst the daye of vengeaunce, when shalbe opened the ryghtewes iudgement of God,
Rom.2.6	which wyll reward euery man accordynge to hys dedes:
Rom.2.7	that is to saye, prayse, honoure and immortalite, to them whych contynue in good doyng; and seke immortalite.
Rom.2.8	But vnto them that are rebelles, and that do not obey the trueth, but folowe vnryghteousnes, shall come indignacyon and wrath,
Rom.2.9	tribulacyon and anguysshe vpon the soule of euery man that doth euyll: of the Iewe fyrst, and also of the Gentyle.
Rom.2.10	To euery man that doth good, shall come prayse, and honoure, and peace, to the Iewe fyrst, and also to the Gentyll.
Rom.2.11	For ther is no respecte of parsonnes, with God. For whosoeuer hath synned wythout lawe,
Rom.2.12	shall also perysshe without lawe. And as many as haue synned in the lawe, shalbe iudged by the lawe.
Rom.2.13	For in the syght of God, they are not ryghteous which beare the lawe: but the doers of the lawe shalbe iustifyed.
Rom.2.14	For whan the Gentyls which haue not the lawe, do of nature the thynges contayned in the lawe: then they hauynge not the lawe, are a lawe vnto them selues,
Rom.2.15	which shew the dede of the lawe wrytten in theyr hertes: whyll theyr conscience beareth wytnes vnto them, and also theyr thoughtes, accusynge one another or excusynge,
Rom.2.16	at the daye when the Lord shall iudge the secretes of men by Iesus Christ, accordynge to my Gospell.
Rom.2.17	Beholde, thou art called a Iewe, and trustest in the lawe, and makest thy boast of God,
Rom.2.18	and knowest his wyll, and alowest the thynges that be excellent, and art infourmed by the lawe:
Rom.2.19	and beleuest that thou thy selfe art a gyde of the blynde, a lyght of them which are in darcknes,
Rom.2.20	an infourmer of them which lacke discrecyon, a teacher of the vnlearned, which hast that ensample of knowledge, Ꟶ of the truthe by the lawe.
Rom.2.21	Thou therfore which teachest another, teachest not thy selfe Thou preachest, a man shulde not steale: yet thou stealest.
Rom.2.22	Thou that sayst, a man shuld not commyt aduoutry, breakest wedlocke. Thou abhorrest ymages, and yet robbest God of his honoure.
Rom.2.23	Thou that makest thy boast of the lawe, thorow breakynge the lawe dishonourest God.
Rom.2.24	For the name of God is euyll spoken of amonge the Gentyls, thorow you as it is wrytten.
Rom.2.25	For circumcisyon verely auayleth, yf thou kepe the lawe. But yf thou be a breaker of the lawe, thy circumcisyon is turned to vncircumcisyon.
Rom.2.26	Therfore, yf the vncircumcised kepe the ryght thynges contayned in the lawe, shall not his vncircumcisyon be counted for circumcisyon?
Rom.2.27	And shall not vncircumcisyon which is by nature (yf it kepe the lawe) iudge the, whych beynge vnder the letter and circumcisyon, doest transgresse the lawe?
Rom.2.28	He is not a Iewe, which is a Iewe outwarde. Nether is it circumcisyon, which is outwarde in the flesshe.
Rom.2.29	But he is a Iewe which his hyd wythin, and the circumcisyon of the herte is the true circumcisyon, whych consisteth in the sprete and not in the letter: whose prayse is not of men, but of God.
Rom.3.1	What preferment then hath the Iewe? or what aduauntageth circumcisyon?
Rom.3.2	Surely verye moch. Fyrst because that vnto them were commytted the wordes of God.
Rom.3.3	What then though some of them dyd not beleue? shall theyr vnbeleue make the promes of God without effecte?
Rom.3.4	God forbyd Let God be true, and euery man a lyar, at it is wrytten: that thou myghtest be iustifyed in thy sayinges, and ouercome, when thou art iudged.
Rom.3.5	But yf oure vnryghtewesnes make the ryghtewesnes of God more excellent: what shall we saye? Is God vnryghteous, which taketh vngeaunce? I speake after the maner of men:
Rom.3.6	God forbyd. For how then shall God iudge the worlde?
Rom.3.7	For yf the trueth of God appeare more excellent thorow my lye, vnto his prayse, why am I hence forth iudged as a synner:
Rom.3.8	and not rather (as men speake euyll of vs, and as some affyrme that we saye) let vs do euyll, that good maye come therof. Whose damnacyon is iuste.
Rom.3.9	What then? Are we better then they? No, in no wyse. For we haue all ready proued, how that both Iewes and Gentyls are all vnder synne,
Rom.3.10	as it is wrytten. there is none ryghteous, no not one:
Rom.3.11	there is none that vnderstandeth, there is none that seketh after God:
Rom.3.12	they are all gone out of the waye, they are all vnprofytable, ther is none that doeth good, no not one.
Rom.3.13	Theyr throte is an open sepulcre, with theyr tounges they haue disceaued: the poyson of aspes is vnder theyr lyppes.
Rom.3.14	Whose mouth is full of curssynge and bytternes.
Rom.3.15	Their fete are swyfte to shed bloud.
Rom.3.16	Destruccyon and wretchednes are in theyr wayes,
Rom.3.17	and the waye of peace haue they not knowen.
Rom.3.18	There is no feare of God before theyr eyes.
Rom.3.19	We knowe that what thynges soeuer the lawe sayth, it sayth it to them which are vnder the lawe. That all mouthes maye be stopped, Ꟶ that all the worlde maye be subdued to God,
Rom.3.20	because that by the dedes of the lawe ther shall no flesshe be iustifyed in hys syght. For by the lawe commeth the knowledge of sinne.
Rom.3.21	But now is the ryghtewesnes of God declared wythout the lawe, for asmoch as it is alowed by the testimonye of the lawe and of the Prophetes.
Rom.3.22	The ryghtewesnes of God, commeth by the fayth of Iesus Christ, vnto all and vpon all them that beleue. Ther is no dyfference:
Rom.3.23	for all haue synned, and are destitute of the glorye of God:
Rom.3.24	but are iustifyed frely by his grace, through the redempcyon that is in Christ Iesu,
Rom.3.25	whom God hath set forth to be the obtayner of mercy thorow fayth, by the meanes of hys bloude, to declare hys ryghteousnes, in that he forgeueth the synnes that are passed, whych God dyd suffre,
Rom.3.26	to shewe at thys tyme hys ryghtewesnes, that he might be counted iust, and the iustifyar of hym whych beleueth on Iesus.
Rom.3.27	Where is then thy reioysynge? It is excluded. By what lawe? of workes? Naye: but by the lawe of fayth.
Rom.3.28	Therfore we holde, that a man is iustifyed by fayth without the dedes of the lawe:
Rom.3.29	Is he the God of the Iewes onely? Is he not also the God of the Gentyls? Yes, euen of the Gentyls also.
Rom.3.30	For it is God only which iustifyeth the circumcisyon that is of fayth, and vncircumcisyon thorow fayth
Rom.3.31	Do we then destroye the lawe thorow fayth? God forbyd. But we rather maintayne the lawe.
Rom.4.1	What shall we saye then, that Abraham oure father (as pertaynynge to the flesshe) dyd fynde?
Rom.4.2	If Abraham were iustyfyed by dedes, then hath he wherin to reioyce: but not wt God.
Rom.4.3	For what sayth the scripture? Abraham beleued God, and it was counted vnto him for ryghtewesnes.
Rom.4.4	To hym that worketh, is the rewarde not reckned of fauoure, but of dutye.
Rom.4.5	To hym that worketh not, but beleueth on him that iustifyeth the vngodly, is his fayth counted for ryghtewesnes.
Rom.4.6	Euen as Dauid describeth the blessedfulnes of that man, vnto whom God imputeth ryghtewesnes wythout dedes.
Rom.4.7	Blessed are they, whose vnryghtewesnes are forgeuen, and whose synnes are couered
Rom.4.8	Blessed is that man, to whom the Lorde wyll not impute synne.
Rom.4.9	Came this blessednes then vpon the vncircumcisyon, or vpon the circumcisyon also? For we saye, that fayth was rekened to Abraham for ryghtewesnes.
Rom.4.10	How was it then rekened? whan he was in the circumcisyon? or whan he was in the vncircumcysyon? Not in the tyme of circumcisyon: but when he was yet vncircumcised.
Rom.4.11	And he receaued the sygne of circumcisyon, as a seale of the ryghtewesnes of fayth, whych he had yet beynge vncircumcysed, that he shulde be the father of all them that beleue, though they be not circumcised, that ryghtewesnes myght be imputed to them also:
Rom.4.12	and that he myght be father of circumcisyon, not vnto them onely whych came of the circumcised, but vnto them also that walke in the steppes of the fayth that was in oure father Abraham, before the tyme of circumcisyon.
Rom.4.13	For the promes (that he shuld be the heyre of the worlde) happened not to Abraham or to his seed thorow the lawe: but thorow the ryghtewesnes of fayth.
Rom.4.14	For yf they whych are of the lawe, be heyres, then is fayth but vayne and the promes of none effecte.
Rom.4.15	Because the lawe causeth wrath. For where no lawe is, there is no transgressyon.
Rom.4.16	Therfore by fayth is the inheritaunce geuen, that it myght come of fauoure: that the promes myght be sure to all the seed. Not to them onely whych are of the lawe: but to them also which are of the fayth of Abraham, which is the father of vs all.
Rom.4.17	(As it is wrytten: I haue made the a father of many nacyons) euen before God, whom he beleued, whych restoreth the deed vnto lyfe: and calleth those thynges whych be not, as though they were.
Rom.4.18	Whych Abraham, contrary to hope, beleued in hope, that he shulde be the father of many nacyons, accordynge to that whych was spoken:
Rom.4.19	euen so shall thy seed be. And he faynted not in the fayth, nor yet consydered his awne body whych was now deed, euen when he was almost an hondred yeare olde: nether yet that Sara was past chyldeberinge.
Rom.4.20	He stackered not at the promes of God thorow vnbelefe: but became stronge in fayth, and gaue God the prayse,
Rom.4.21	beynge full certifyed, that he whych had promised the same was able also to make it good.
Rom.4.22	And therfore was it reckened to hym for ryghtewesnes.
Rom.4.23	Neuertheles it is not wrytten for hym onely, that it was reckened to hy
Rom.4.24	but also for vs, to whom it shalbe counted so that we beleue on hym, that raysed vp Iesus oure Lorde from the deed:
Rom.4.25	whych was delyuered for oure synnes, and was raysed agayne for oure iustificacyon.
Rom.5.1	Because therfore that we are iustifyed by fayth, we are at peace with God, thorow oure Lorde Iesus Christ:
Rom.5.2	by whom also it chaunsed vnto vs to be brought in thorow fayth, vnto thys grace, wherin we stande, and reioyce in hope of the glory of God.
Rom.5.3	Not that onely: but also we reioyce in tribulacyons: knowyng that tribulacyon bryngeth pacience,
Rom.5.4	pacience bryngeth experience, experience bryngeth hope.
Rom.5.5	And hope maketh not ashamed: because the loue of God is sheed abroad in oure hertes, by the holy ghost whych is geuen vnto vs.
Rom.5.6	For when we were yet weake, accordyng to the tyme, Christ dyed for vs whych were vngodly:
Rom.5.7	Yet scace wyll eny man dye for a ryghtewes man. Parauenture for a good man durst a man dye.
Rom.5.8	But God setteth out his loue toward vs, seynge that whyll we were yet synners Christ dyed for vs.
Rom.5.9	Moch more then now (we that are iustifyed by hys bloud) shall be saued from wrath thorow hym.
Rom.5.10	For yf when we were enemyes, we were reconcyled to God by the deeth of hys sonne: moch more, seynge we are reconcyled, we shalbe preserued by hys lyfe.
Rom.5.11	Not onely this, but we also ioye in God by the meanes of oure Lorde Iesus Christ, by whom we haue now optayned the attonment.
Rom.5.12	Wherfore, as by one man, synne entred into the worlde, and deeth by the meanes of synne.
Rom.5.13	Euen so deeth also went ouer all men, in so moch as all we haue synned. For euen vnto the lawe was synne in the worlde, but synne is not imputed, whan ther is no lawe:
Rom.5.14	neuerthelesse deeth raygned from Adam to Moses, euen ouer them also that had not synned wyth lyke transgression as dyd Adam: which beareth the similitude of him that was to come.
Rom.5.15	But the gyfte is not lyke as the synne. For yf thorow the synne of one, many be deed: moche more plenteous vpon many was the grace of God Ꟶ gyfte by grace; whych was of one man Iesus Christ.
Rom.5.16	And the gyfte is not ouer one synne: as deeth cam thorow one synne of one that synned. For damnacyon came of one synne vnto condemnacyon: but the gyft came to iustify from many synnes.
Rom.5.17	For yf by the synne of one, deeth raygned by the meanes of one: moch more they (whych receaue aboundance of grace and of the gyfte of ryghtewesnes) shall raygne in lyfe by the meanes of one (that is to saye) Iesus Christ.
Rom.5.18	Lyke wyse then as by the synne of one there sprang vp euell on all men to condemnacyon: euen so by the ryghteousnes of one, spryngeth good vpon all men to the ryghteousnes of lyfe.
Rom.5.19	For as by one mannes disobedience many became synners: so by the obedience of one, shall many be made ryghteous.
Rom.5.20	But the lawe in the meane tyme entred in, the synne shulde encreace. Neuerthelater where aboundance of synne was, there was more plenteousnes of grace.
Rom.5.21	That as synne had raygned vnto deeth, euen so myght grace raygne thorow ryghtewesnes, vnto eternall lyfe, by the helpe of Iesu Christ.
Rom.6.1	What shall we saye then? Shall we contynue in synne, that there maye be aboundance of grace?
Rom.6.2	God forbyd. How shall we that are deed as touchyng synne, lyue eny lenger therin?
Rom.6.3	Knowe ye not that all we whych are baptysed into Iesu Christe are baptysed to dye wyth him?
Rom.6.4	We are buryed then with him by baptyme, for to dye: that lyke wyse as Christ was raysed vp from deeth by the glorye of the father, euen so we also shulde walke in a newe lyfe.
Rom.6.5	For yf we be graft in deeth lyke vnto hym: euen so shall we be partakers of the resurreccyon:
Rom.6.6	knowyng thys, that oure olde man is crucifyed with hym also, that the body of sinne myght vtterly be destroyed, that hence forth we shuld not be seruauntes vnto synne.
Rom.6.7	For he that is deed, is iustifyed from synne.
Rom.6.8	Wherefore yf we be deed wt Christ, we beleue, that we shall also lyue with hym:
Rom.6.9	knowyng, that Christ beyng raysed from deeth, dyeth nomore. Deeth hath nomore power ouer hym.
Rom.6.10	For as touchynge that he dyed, he dyed concernynge synne once. And as touchynge that he lyueth, he lyueth vnto God.
Rom.6.11	Lykewyse consydre ye also, that ye are deed as touchyng synne, but are alyue vnto God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde
Rom.6.12	Let not synne raygne therfore in youre mortall bodye, that ye shulde ther vnto obey by the lustes of it.
Rom.6.13	Nether geue ye youre membres as instrumentes of vnryghtewesnes vnto synne: but geue ouer your selues vnto God as they that of deed, are alyue. And geue ouer youre members as instrumentes of ryghtewesnes vnto God.
Rom.6.14	For synne shall not haue power ouer you. Because ye are not vnder the lawe, but vnder grace.
Rom.6.15	What then? Shall we synne, because we are not vnder the lawe: but vnder grace? God forbyd.
Rom.6.16	Knowe ye not, how that to whom soeuer ye commit youre selues as seruauntes to obey, hys seruauntes ye are to whom ye obey: whether it be of synne vnto deeth, or of obedience vnto ryghtewesnes?
Rom.6.17	God be thanked, that though ye were the seruauntes of synne, ye haue yet obeyed with herte vnto the rule of the doctryne, that ye be brought vnto.
Rom.6.18	Ye are then made fre from synne, and are become the seruauntes of ryghtewesnes.
Rom.6.19	I speake grosly, because of the infirmytie of youre fleshe. As ye haue geuen youre members seruauntes to vnclennes and to iniquitye, (from one iniquitye to another) euen so now geue ouer youre members seruauntes vnto ryghtewesnes, that ye maye be sanctifyed.
Rom.6.20	For when ye were the seruauntes of synne, ye were voyde of ryghtewesnes.
Rom.6.21	What frute had ye then in those thynges, wherof ye are now asshamed. For the ende of those thynges, is deeth.
Rom.6.22	But now are ye delyuered from synne, Ꟶ made the seruauntes of God, and haue youre frute to be sanctifyed, and the ende euerlastynge lyfe.
Rom.6.23	For the rewarde of synne is deeth. but eternall lyfe is the gyfte of God, thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde.
Rom.7.1	Knowe ye not brethren (I speake to them that knowe the lawe) how that the lawe hath power ouer a man, as longe as it endureth.
Rom.7.2	For the woman whych is in subiecyon to a man, is bounde by the lawe to the man, as longe as he lyueth. But yf the man be deed, she is loosed from the lawe of the man,
Rom.7.3	So then yf whyle the man lyueth she couple her selfe with another man, she shalbe counted a wedlocke breaker. But yf the man be deed, she is fre from the lawe of the husband, so that she is no wedlocke breaker, though she couple her selfe with another man.
Rom.7.4	Euen so ye also (my brethren) are deed concernynge the lawe by the body of Chryst, that ye shulde be coupled to another (I meane to him that is rysen agayne from deeth) that we shuld brynge forth frute vnto God.
Rom.7.5	For when we were in the flesshe, the lustes of synne whych were stered vp by the lawe, raygned in oure members, to brynge forth frute vnto deeth.
Rom.7.6	But now are we delyuered from the lawe, and deed vnto it wher vnto we were in bondage, that we shuld serue in a new conuersacyon of the sprete, and not in the olde conuersacyon of the letter.
Rom.7.7	What shall we saye then? is the lawe synne? God forbyd: neuertheles I knew not synne, but by the lawe. For I had not knowne what lust had meant, excepte the lawe had sayd, thou shalt not lust.
Rom.7.8	But synne toke an occasyon by the meanes of the commaundement and wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For verely without the lawe, synne was deed.
Rom.7.9	I once lyued wythout lawe. But when the commaundement came, synne reuiued, and I was deed.
Rom.7.10	And the very same commaundement, whych was ordeyned vnto lyfe, was founde to be vnto me an occasyon of deeth.
Rom.7.11	For synne toke occasyon by the meanes of the commaundement, and so disceaued me, Ꟶ by the same slewe me.
Rom.7.12	Wherfore the lawe is holy, and the commaundement holy, and iust and good.
Rom.7.13	Was that then which was good, made deeth vnto me? God forbyd. Naye it was synne: that sinne might appeare (by it which was good) to worke deeth in me: that synne by the commaundement myght be out of measure synfull.
Rom.7.14	For we knowe, that the lawe is spirituall: but I am carnall solde vnder synne,
Rom.7.15	because I alowe not that whych I do. For what I wold, that do I not: but what I hate, that do I.
Rom.7.16	If I do now that whych I wolde not, I consente vnto the lawe that it is good.
Rom.7.17	So then now, it is not I that do it, but synne that dwelleth in me.
Rom.7.18	For I knowe, that in me (that is to saye in my flesshe) dwelleth no good thinge. For, to wyll is present with me: but I fynde no meanes to performe that whych is good.
Rom.7.19	For the good that I wolde, do I not: but the euyll whych I wolde not, that do I.
Rom.7.20	Yf I do that I wolde not, then is it not I that do it, but synne that dwelleth in me.
Rom.7.21	I fynde then by the lawe, that when I wolde do good, euyll is present wyth me.
Rom.7.22	For I delyte in the lawe of God, after the inward man.
Rom.7.23	But I se another lawe in my membres, rebellynge agaynst the lawe of my mynde, and subduynge me vnto the lawe of synne, whych is in my members.
Rom.7.24	O wretched man that I am: who shall delyuer me from thys body subdued vnto deeth?
Rom.7.25	I thanke God thorow Iesus Christ oure Lorde. So then, wyth the mynde I serue the lawe of God, but wyth the flesshe the lawe of synne.
Rom.8.1	Ther is then no damnacyon to them whych are in Chryst Iesu, whych walke not after the flesshe, but after the sprete.
Rom.8.2	For the lawe of the sprete of lyfe thorow Iesus Christ, hath made me fre from the lawe of synne, and deeth.
Rom.8.3	For what the lawe could not do (in as moch as it was weake because of the flesshe) that performed God, and sent hys sonne in the similitude of synfull flesshe,
Rom.8.4	and by synne dampned synne in the flesshe: that the ryghtewesnes of the lawe, myght be fulfylled in vs, which walke not after the flesshe, but after the sprete.
Rom.8.5	For they that are carnall, are carnally mynded. But they that are spirytuall, are gostly mynded.
Rom.8.6	To be carnally mynded, is deeth. But to be spiritually mynded, is lyfe and peace.
Rom.8.7	Because that the flesshly mynde is enemyte agaynst God: for it is not obedyent to the lawe of God, nether can be.
Rom.8.8	So then they that are in the flesshe, cannot please God.
Rom.8.9	But ye are not in the flesshe, but in the sprete: yf so be that the sprete of God dwell in you. If eny man haue not the spryte of Chryst, the same is none of hys.
Rom.8.10	If Chryst be in you, the body is deed because of synne: but the spryte is lyfe for ryghtewesnes sake.
Rom.8.11	Wherfore, yf the spryte of hym that raysed vp Iesus from deeth, dwell in you: euen he that raysed vp Chryst from deeth, shall quycken youre mortall bodyes, because of hys sprete that dwelleth in you.
Rom.8.12	Therfore brethren, we are detters, not to the flesshe,
Rom.8.13	to lyue after the fleshe. For yf ye lyue after the fleshe, ye shal dye. But yf ye (thorowe the sprete) do mortyfye the dedes of the body, ye shall lyue.
Rom.8.14	For as many as are led by the sprete of God,
Rom.8.15	they are the sonnes of God. For ye haue not receaued the sprete of bondage to feare eny mor are, but ye haue receaued the sprete of adopcyon, wherby we crye: Abba father.
Rom.8.16	The same sprete certyfyeth oure sprete that we are the sonnes of God.
Rom.8.17	If we be sonnes, then are we also heyres, the heyres I meane of God, Ꟶ heyres anexed with Chryst yf so be that we suffer with hym, that we maye be also glorified together with hym.
Rom.8.18	For I suppose that the afflyccyons of thys lyfe, are not worthy of the glory, which shalbe shewed vpon vs.
Rom.8.19	For the feruent desyre of the creature abydeth, lokyng, when the sonnes of God shall appere,
Rom.8.20	because the creature is subdued to vanyte, agaynst the wyll therof, but for his will which hath subdued the same in hope.
Rom.8.21	For the same creature shalbe delyuered from the bondage of corrupcyon, into the gloryous libertye of the sonnes of God.
Rom.8.22	For we knowe, that euery creature groneth with vs also, and trauayleth in payne, euen vnto thys tyme.
Rom.8.23	Not onely it, but we also which haue the fyrst frutes of the spryte, morne in oure selues also, and wayte for the adopcyon euen the delyueraunce of oure bodye.
Rom.8.24	For we are sauyd by hope. But hope that is sene, is no hope. For how can a man hope for that, which he seyth?
Rom.8.25	But and yf we hope for that we se not, then do we wt pacience abyde for it.
Rom.8.26	Lyke wyse, the sprete also helpeth oure infirmyties. For we knowe not what to desyre as we ought: but the sprete maketh intercessyon for vs, with gronynges which cannot be expressed.
Rom.8.27	And he that searcheth the hertes knoweth, what is the meanynge of the spryte: for he maketh intercercessyon for the sayntes according to the pleasure of God.
Rom.8.28	We knowe that all thynhes worke for the best vnto them that loue God, which also are called of purpose.
Rom.8.29	For those which he knewe before, he also ordeyned before, that they shulde be lyke fassyoned vnto the shape of hys sonne, that he myght be the fyrst begotten sonne amonge many brethren.
Rom.8.30	Moreouer, whom he appoynted before, them also he called. And whom he hath called, them also he iustyfyed: and whom he iustyfyed, them he also gloryfyed.
Rom.8.31	What shall we then saye to these thinges? yf God be on oure syde, who can be agaynst vs?
Rom.8.32	which spared not hys awne sonne, but gaue him for vs all: how can it be, that with hym he shulde not geue vs all thynges also?
Rom.8.33	Who shall laye eny thynge to the charge of Goddes chosen; it is God that iustyfyeth:
Rom.8.34	who is he that can condempne? it is Chryst which dyed, yee, rather which is rysen agayne, which is also on the ryght hande of God, and maketh intercessyon for us.
Rom.8.35	Who shall seperate vs from the loue of God? shall tribulacyon? or angusshe? or persecucyon? other honger? ether nakednesse? ether parell? ether swearde?
Rom.8.36	As it is written: for thy sake are we kylled all daye longe, and are counted as shepe apoynted to be slayne.
Rom.8.37	Neuerthelesse, in all these thynges we ouercome thorowe hym that loued vs.
Rom.8.38	For I am sure, that nether deeth, nether lyfe, nether Angels, nor rule, nether power, nether thynges present, nether thynges to come,
Rom.8.39	nether heygth, nether loweth, nether eny other creature shal be able to departe vs from the loue of God, which is in Christ Iesu oure Lorde.
Rom.9.1	I saye the trueth in Chryst, and lye not, (my conscience also bearing me wytnes by the holy ghost)
Rom.9.2	that I haue gret heuynes, Ꟶ contynuall sorowe in my hert.
Rom.9.3	For I haue wysshed my selfe to be cursed from Chryst, for my brethren (my kynsmen as pertaynynge to the flesshe)
Rom.9.4	which are the Israelites. To whom pertayneth the adopcyon, and the glorye, and the couenauntes and the lawe that was geuen, and the seruyce of God, and the promyses:
Rom.9.5	whose also are the fathers, and they of whom (as concernynge the flesshe) Christ came, which is God in all thynges to be praysed for euer Amen.
Rom.9.6	I speake not these thynges, as though the wordes of God had take none effecte. For they are not all Israelites, which are of Israell:
Rom.9.7	nether are they all chyldren strayght waye, that are the seed of Abraham. But in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
Rom.9.8	that is to saye: they which are the chyldren of the flesshe, are not the children of God. But they which be the chyldren of promes, are counted the seede.
Rom.9.9	For this is a worde of promes, about thys tyme wyll I come, and Sara shall haue a sonne.
Rom.9.10	Not onely thys, but also Rebecca was wt chylde by one, euen by oure father Isaac.
Rom.9.11	For yer the chyldren were borne, when they had nether done good nether bad (that the purpose of God by eleccyon, myght stande) it was sayde vnto her, not by the reason of workes, but by the caller:
Rom.9.12	the elder shall serue the younger.
Rom.9.13	As it is wrytten: Iacob haue I loued, but Esau haue I hated.
Rom.9.14	What shall we saye then? is there eny vnrightewesnes with God? God forbyd.
Rom.9.15	For he sayth to Moses: I wyll shewe mercy to whomsoeuer I shewe mercy: and wyll haue compassyon,
Rom.9.16	on whomsoeuer I haue compassyon. So lyeth it not then in a mans wyll or runnynge, but in the mercye of God.
Rom.9.17	For the scripture sayth vnto Pharao: euen for thys same purpose haue I stered the vp, to shewe my power on the, and that my name myght be declared thorow out all the worlde.
Rom.9.18	So hath he mercye on whom he wyll, and whom he wyll, he maketh harde herted.
Rom.9.19	Thou wylt saye then vnto me: why then blameth he vs yet? For who hath bene able to resist his wyll?
Rom.9.20	But O man, what art thou, which disputest with God? Shall the worcke saye to the worke man: why hast thou made me on this fassyon?
Rom.9.21	Hath not the potter power ouer the claye, euen of the same lompe to make one vessel vnto honoure, and another vnto dishonoure?
Rom.9.22	Euen so, God willyng to shewe hys wrath, and to make his power knowen suffered wyth longe pacyence the vessels of wrath, ordeyned to damnacyon,
Rom.9.23	and to declare the ryches of hys glory on the vessels of mercye, which he had prepared vnto glorye:
Rom.9.24	whom also he called, not of the Iewes onely, but also of the gentyls.
Rom.9.25	As he sayth also to Osee? I wyll call them my people which were not my people: and her beloued which was not beloued, (and her to haue optayned mercy, that had not optayned mercy)
Rom.9.26	And it shall come to passe, that in the place where it was sayde vnto them: ye are not my people: there shall they be called the chyldren of the lyuynge God.
Rom.9.27	But Esay cryeth concerning Israel though the nombre of the chyldren of Israel be as the sonde of the see, yet the remnaunt shall be saued
Rom.9.28	For he fynyssheth the word verely, and maketh it short in ryghtewesnes. For a short worde wil God make on erth.
Rom.9.29	And as Esay sayd before: except the Lorde of Saboth had left vs seede, we had bene made as zodoma, and had bene lykened to Gomorra.
Rom.9.30	What shall we saye then? We saye, that the gentyls which folowed not ryghtewesnes, haue ouertaken ryghtewesnes: euen the ryghtewesnes which cometh of fayth.
Rom.9.31	Contrary wyse, Israel which folowed the lawe of rightwesnes could not attaine to the lawe of ryghtewsnes.
Rom.9.32	Wherfore? euen because they sought it not by fayth: but as it were by the workes of the lawe. For they haue stombled at the stombylynge stone.
Rom.9.33	As it is wrytten: Behold, I put in Syon a stomblynge stone, Ꟶ a rocke that men shalbe offended at. And whosoeuer beleueth on hym, shall not be confounded.
Rom.10.1	Brethren, my hertes desyre Ꟶ prayer to God for Israelis, that they myght be saued.
Rom.10.2	For I beare them recorde, that they haue a feruent mynde to God warde, but not according to knowledge.
Rom.10.3	For they beynge ignoraunt of Goddes ryghtewesnes, and goynge aboute to stablysshe theyr awne ryghtewesnes, haue not bene obedient vnto the ryghtewesnes of God.
Rom.10.4	For Christ is the fulfyllyng of the lawe, to iustyfye all that beleue.
Rom.10.5	For Moses wrytteth of the ryghtewesnes which cometh of the lawe, how that the man whych doth the thynges of the lawe, shall lyue therby.
Rom.10.6	But the ryghtewesnes which cometh of fayth, speaketh on thys wyse: Saye not thou in thyne hert. who shall ascende into heauen (that is euen to fetch Chryst downe from aboue.)
Rom.10.7	Other who shall descende into the depe? (that is euen to fetch vp Christ agayne from deeth)
Rom.10.8	But what sayth he? The worde is nye the, euen in thy mouth and in thyne herte. Thys same is the worde of fayth, which we preache.
Rom.10.9	For yf thou knowledge with thy mouth that Iesus is the Lorde, Ꟶ beleue in thyne hert, that God raysed hym vp from deeth, thou shalt be safe.
Rom.10.10	For to beleue wt the hert iustyfyeth: and to knowledge with the mouth, maketh a man safe.
Rom.10.11	For the scrypture sayth: whosoeuer beleueth on hym, shall not be confounded.
Rom.10.12	There is no difference betwene the Iewe and the Gentill. For one is Lord of all, which is ryche vnto all that call vpon him.
Rom.10.13	For whosoeuer doth call on the name of the Lord, shalbe safe.
Rom.10.14	How then shall they call on hym, on whom they haue not beleued? how shall they beleue on hym, of whom they haue not hearde? how shall they heare, without a preacher?
Rom.10.15	And how shall they preache except they be sent? As it is written: how beautyfull are the fete of them which brynge tydynges of peace, and brynge tydynges of good thynges.
Rom.10.16	But they haue not all obeyed to the Gospell. For Esay sayth: Lorde, who hath beleued oure sayinges?
Rom.10.17	So then fayth cometh by hearynge, and hearynge cometh by the worde of God.
Rom.10.18	But I aske: haue they not herde? No dout, their sounde went out into all landes: and their wordes into the endes of the worlde.
Rom.10.19	But I demaunde, whether Israel dyd knowe or not? Fyrst Moses sayth: I will prouoke you to enuy, by them that are no people: by a folysihe nacion I wyll anger you.
Rom.10.20	Esay after that, is bolde and sayeth: I am founde of them, that sought me not: I am manyfest vnto them, that asked not after me.
Rom.10.21	But agaynst Israell he sayth: all daye longe haue I stretched forth my handes vnto a people that beleueth not, but speaketh agaynst me.
Rom.11.1	I saye then: hath God cast awaye hys people? God forbyd. For euen I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the trybe of Beniamin,
Rom.11.2	God hath not cast awaye his people, which he knewe before. Wote ye not, what the scripture sayth of Helias, how he maketh intercession to God agaynst Israell, saying:
Rom.11.3	Lorde, they haue kylled thy Prophetes, and dygged downe thyne alters: and I am lefte alone, and they seke my lyfe.
Rom.11.4	But what sayth the answere of God vnto hym? I haue reserued vnto my selfe seuen thousande men, which haue not bowed the knee to the ymage of Ball.
Rom.11.5	Euen so also at thys tyme is ther a remanaunt lefte accordynge to the eleccyon of grace.
Rom.11.6	If it be of grace, then is it not now of workes. For then grace is nomore grace. But If it be of workes, then is it now no grace. For then were deseruynge nomore deseruynge.
Rom.11.7	What then? Israel hath not obtayned that which he seketh: but the eleccyon hath obtayned it. The remnaunt are blynded
Rom.11.8	accordynge as it is written. God hath geuen them the sprete of vnquyetnes: eyes that they shuld not se, Ꟶ eares that they shuld not heare, euen vnto this daye.
Rom.11.9	And Dauid sayth: Let their table be made a snare to take them with all, and an occasyon to fall, and a reward vnto them.
Rom.11.10	Let theyr eyes be blynded that they se not: and bowe thou downe their backe allwaye.
Rom.11.11	I saye then: haue they therfore stombled, that they shuld vtterly fall awaye together. God forbyd: but thorowe theyr fall is saluacyon happened vnto the Gentyls, for to prouoke them withall.
Rom.11.12	Wherfore yf the fall of them be the ryches of the worlde, and the mynisshynge of them the ryches of the gentyls: How moch more their perfectnesse?
Rom.11.13	I speake to you gentyls, in as moch as I am the Apostle of the gentyls, I wyll magnify myne office,
Rom.11.14	yf by any meane I maye prouoke them which are my flesshe, and myght saue some of them.
Rom.11.15	For yf the castynge awaye of them, be the reconcylynge of the world: what shall the receauynge of them be, but lyfe agayne from deeth?
Rom.11.16	For yf one pece be holy, the whole heepe is holy. And yf the rote be holy, the braunches shalbe holy also.
Rom.11.17	Though some of the braunches be broken of, and thou beynge a wylde olyue tree, wast graft in among them, and made partaker of the rote and fatnes of the olyue tree,
Rom.11.18	boast not thy selfe agaynst the braunches. For yf thou boast thy selfe, thou bearest not the rote, but the rote the.
Rom.11.19	Thou wilt saye then: the braunches are broken of that I myght be graft in.
Rom.11.20	Thou sayest well: because of vnbeleue they were broken of, and thou stodest stedfast in fayth.
Rom.11.21	Be not hye mynded, but feare: for seynge that God spared not the naturall braunches, take hede, lest it come to passe that he spare not the also.
Rom.11.22	Beholde therfore the kyndnes and rygorousnes of God: on them which fell, rygorousnes. but towardes the, kyndnes: yf thou continue in hys kyndnes. Or els thou shalt be hewen of,
Rom.11.23	and they agayne yf they byde not styll in vnbelefe, shalbe graffed in agayne. For God is of power to graffe them in agayne.
Rom.11.24	For yf thou wast cut out of a naturall wylde olyue tree, and wast graffed contrary to nature in a true olyue tree: how moch more shall the naturall braunches be graffed in their awne olyue tree agayne.
Rom.11.25	I wolde not that this secrete shulde be hyd from you my brethren (lest ye shuld be wyse in youre awne consaytes) that partly blyndnes is happened in Israell, vntyll the fulnes of the gentyls be come in:
Rom.11.26	and so all Israel shalbe saued. As it is wrytten. There shall come out of Syon he that doth delyuer, and shall turne awaye vngodlynes from Iacob.
Rom.11.27	And thys is my couenaunt vnto them, when I shall take awaye their synnes.
Rom.11.28	As concernynge the gospell they are enemies for youre sakes: but as touchyng the eleccyon they are loued for the fathers sakes.
Rom.11.29	For verely, the gyftes and callynge of God are soch, that it cannot repent hym of them:
Rom.11.30	for loke, as ye in tyme passed haue not beleued God, yet haue now obtained mercy thorow their vnbelefe:
Rom.11.31	euen so now haue they not beleued the mercy which is happened vnto you: that they also maye obtayne mercy.
Rom.11.32	For God had wrapped all nacyons in vnbeleue, that he myght haue mercy on all.
Rom.11.33	O the depnes of the ryches both of the wysdome and knowledge of God: how vnsercheable are his iudgementes, Ꟶ his wayes past fyndynge out;
Rom.11.34	For who hath knowen the mynde of the Lorde? Or who hath bene hys counseller?
Rom.11.35	other who hath geuen vnto hym fyrst, and he shalbe recompensed agayne?
Rom.11.36	For of hym, and thorow hym, and for hym are all thynges: To hym be glorye for euer. Amen.
Rom.12.1	I beseche you therfore brethren, by the mercyfulnes of God, that ye make yor bodies a quycke sacryfice, holy Ꟶ acceptable vnto God: which is youre resonable seruynge of God
Rom.12.2	Ꟶ fassyon not youre selues lyke vnto this worlde: but be ye chaunged in youre shape, by the renuyng of your mynde, that ye maye proue what thynge that good, and acceptable, and perfaycte wyll of God is.
Rom.12.3	For I saye (thorowe the grace that vnto me geuen is) to euery man amonge you, that noman stonde hye in his owne conceate, more then it becommeth hym to esteme of him selfe: but so iudge of hym selfe, that he be gentle and sober, accordynge, as God hath dealte to euery man the measure of fayth.
Rom.12.4	For as we haue many membres in one body, and all members haue not one office:
Rom.12.5	so we beynge many, are one body in Chryst, and euery man among oure selues, one anothers members.
Rom.12.6	Seynge that we haue diuers gyftes accordynge to the grace that is geuen vnto vs: yf eny man haue the gyft of prophesye, let him haue it that it be agreyng vnto the fayth.
Rom.12.7	Let hym that hath an office wayte on his office. Let him that teacheth take hede to hys doctryne.
Rom.12.8	Let hym that exhorteth, geue attendaunce to his exhortacion. If eny man geue, let hym do it with synglenes. Let hym that ruleth, do it wit diligence. If eny man shewe mercy, let hym do it with cherfulnes.
Rom.12.9	Let loue be without dissimulacion Hate that which is euyll Ꟶ cleaue vnto that which is good.
Rom.12.10	Be kynd one to another wich brotherly loue. In geuynge honoure, go one before another.
Rom.12.11	Be not slouthfull in the busynes which ye haue in hande. Be feruent in the sprete. Applye youre selues to the tyme.
Rom.12.12	Reioyce in hope. Be pacient in tribulacion. Continue in prayer.
Rom.12.13	Distribute vnto the necessite of the sayntes: be readie to harboure.
Rom.12.14	Blesse them which persecute you: blesse (I saye) and course not.
Rom.12.15	Be mery with them that are mery. Wepe also with them that wepe.
Rom.12.16	Be of lyke affeccion one towardes another. Be not hye mynded: but make youre selues equall to them of the lower sorte. Be not wyse in youre awne opynyons.
Rom.12.17	Recompence to no man euyll for euyll. Prouyde afore hande thynges honeste in the syght of all men.
Rom.12.18	If it be possyble, (as moch as is in you) lyue peaceably with all men.
Rom.12.19	Dearly beloued, auenge not youre selues, but rather geue place vnto wrath. For it is wrytten: vengeaunce is myne, I wyll rewarde, sayth the Lorde.
Rom.12.20	Therfore, yf thyne enemy honger, fede him: yf he thyrst, geue hym dryncke. For in so doyng thou shalt heape coles of fyre on hys heade.
Rom.12.21	Be not ouercome of euyll, but ouercome euyll, with goodnes:
Rom.13.1	Let euery soule submyt hym selfe vnto the auctoryte of the hyer powers. For there is no power but of God.
Rom.13.2	The powers that be, are ordeyned of God. Whosoeuer therfore resysteth power, resysteth the ordinaunce of God. But they that resyst, shall receaue to them selfe damnacyon.
Rom.13.3	For rulers are not fearfull to them that do good, but to them that do euyll. Wylt thou be without feare of the power? Do well then: and so shalt thou he praysed of the same.
Rom.13.4	For he is the mynyster of God, for thy welth. But and yf thou do that which is, euyll, then feare: for he beareth not the sweard for nought: for he is the mynister of God, to take vengeaunce on hym that doth euyll.
Rom.13.5	Wherfore, ye must nedes obeye, not onely for feare of vengeaunce: but also because of conscience.
Rom.13.6	And euen for this cause paye ye tribute. For they are Goddes mynysters, seruinge for the same purpose.
Rom.13.7	Geue to euery man therfore hys duetye: tribute to whom tribute belongeth: custome, to whom custome is due: feare, to whom feare belongeth: honoure, to whom honoure pertayneth.
Rom.13.8	O we nothynge to eny man: but thys, that ye loue one another. For he that loueth another hath fulfylled the lawe.
Rom.13.9	For these commaundementes. Thou shalt not commytt aduoutry: thou shalt not kyll: thou shalt not steale: thou shalt not beare false wytnes: thou shalt not lust, and so forth (yf there be eny other commaundement) it is all comprehended in thys sayinge, Namely: Loue thyne neyghbour as thy selfe.
Rom.13.10	Loue hurteth not his neyghbour. Therfore is loue the fulfyllinge of the lawe.
Rom.13.11	This also, we knowe the season howe that it is tyme that we shulde now awake out of slepe. For now is oure saluacyon nearer, then when we beleued.
Rom.13.12	The nyght is passed, the daye is come nye. Let vs therfore cast awaye the dedes of darcknes, and let vs put on the Armoure of lyght.
Rom.13.13	Let vs walke honestly as it were in the daye lyght: not in eatynge Ꟶ drynckynge, nether in chamburyng and wantannes, nether in stryfe Ꟶ enuyinge:
Rom.13.14	but put ye on the Lorde Iesus Chryst. And make not prouisyon for the fleshe, to fulfyll the lustes of it.
Rom.14.1	Hym that is weake in the fayth, receaue, not in disputynge and troublynge hys conscience.
Rom.14.2	One beleueth that he maye eate all thynge. Another whych is weake, eateth earbes.
Rom.14.3	Let not hym that eateth, despise hym that eateth not. And let not him whych eateth not, iudge him that eateth. For God hath receaued him.
Rom.14.4	What art thou that iudgest another mannes seruaunt whether he stande or fall that pertayneth vnto hys awne master: ye, he shall be holden vp, that he maye stande. For God is able to make hym stande.
Rom.14.5	This man putteth difference bitwene daye Ꟶ daye. Another man counteth all dayes alyke. Let euery mans mynde satisfye him selfe.
Rom.14.6	He that obserueth the daye, doeth it vnto the Lorde. And he that doth not obserue the daye, doeth it for the Lorde also. He that eateth, doth it to please the Lorde, for he geueth God thankes.
Rom.14.7	And he that eateth not, eateth not, to please the Lorde withall, and geueth God thankes.
Rom.14.8	For none of vs lyueth for hym selfe, and no man dyeth for hym selfe. For yf we lyue, we lyue vnto the Lorde. And yf we dye, we dye vnto the Lord. Whether we lyue therfore, or dye, we are the Lordes.
Rom.14.9	For Christ therfore dyed, and rose agayne, and reuyued, that he myght be Lorde of deed and quycke.
Rom.14.10	But why doest thou then iudge thy brother? Other, why doest thou despise thy brother? We shalbe all brought before the iudgement seate of Christ.
Rom.14.11	For it is written: as truely as I lyue sayth the Lorde: all knees shall bowe to me, and all tonges shall geue prayse to God.
Rom.14.12	So shall euery one of vs geue accomptes of hym selfe to God.
Rom.14.13	Let vs not therfore iudge one another eny more. But iudge thys rather, that no man put a stomblynge blocke, or an occasyon to fall in hys brothers waye.
Rom.14.14	For I knowe, and am full certifyed by the Lorde Iesus, that ther is nothynge comen of it selfe: but vnto hym that iudgeth it to be comen: to hym is it comen.
Rom.14.15	If thy brother be greued wyth thy meate, nowe walkest thou not charitablye. Destroye not hym wyth thy meate, for whom Chryst dyed.
Rom.14.16	Cause not youre treasure to be euyll spoken of.
Rom.14.17	For the kyngdome of God is not meate and drynke: but ryghtwesnes, and peace and ioye in the holy ghost.
Rom.14.18	For he that in these thinges serueth Chryst, pleaseth God, and is commended of men.
Rom.14.19	Let vs therfore folowe those thinges which make for peace, and thynges wherwith one maye edifye another.
Rom.14.20	Destroye not the worke of God for a lytell meates sake. All thinges are pure: but it is euyll for the man: which eateth wyth hurte of conscience.
Rom.14.21	It is good nether to eate flesshe, nether to drinke wyne nether eny thynge, wherby thy brother stombleth, ether falleth, or is made weake.
Rom.14.22	Hast thou fayth? haue it wyth thy selfe before God. Happy is he, that condempneth not hym selfe, in the thynge whych he aloweth.
Rom.14.23	For he that maketh conscience, is dampned yf he eate: because he eateth not of fayth. For whatsoeuer is not of fayth, that same is synne.
Rom.15.1	We whych are stronge ought to beare the fraylnes of them, whych are weake, and not to stonde in oure awne consaytes.
Rom.15.2	Let euery man please hys neyghbour vnto hys welth and edifyinge.
Rom.15.3	For Christ pleased not him selfe: but as it is written. The rebukes of them which rebuked the, fell on me.
Rom.15.4	Whatsoeuer thinges are written afore tyme, they are written for our learnynge, that we thorow pacience and comforte of the scriptures, myght haue hope.
Rom.15.5	The God of pacyence and consolacyon, graunt you, to be lyke mynded one towardes another, after the ensample of Chryst Iesu:
Rom.15.6	that ye all agreynge together maye wyth one mouth prayse God the father of oure Lorde Iesus Chryst.
Rom.15.7	Wherfore, receaue ye one another, as Chryst receaued vs, to the prayse of God.
Rom.15.8	And thys I saye, that Iesus Chryst was a mynister of the circumcisyon for the trueth of God, to conferme the promyses made vnto the fathers:
Rom.15.9	that the gentyls myght prayse God for hys mercy, as it is wrytten. For this cause I will prayse the amonge the gentyls, and synge vnto thy name.
Rom.15.10	And agayne he sayth: reioyse ye gentyles wyth hys people.
Rom.15.11	And agayne, prayse the Lorde all ye gentyls, and laude hym all ye nacyons together.
Rom.15.12	And agayne Esay sayth: ther shalbe the rote of Iesie, and he that shall ryse to raygne ouer the gentyls: in hym shall the gentyls trust.
Rom.15.13	The God of hope fyll you wyth all ioye and peace in beleuyng: that ye maye be ryche in hope, thorow the power of the holy ghost.
Rom.15.14	I my selfe am full certifyed of you (my brethren) that ye also are full of goodnes, Ꟶ fylled with all knowledge, willinge to exhorte one another.
Rom.15.15	Neuerthelesse (brethren) I haue some what more boldly wrytten vnto you, partely to put you in remembraunce, thorow the grace that is geuen me of God,
Rom.15.16	that I shuld be the minister of Iesu Christ amonge the Gentyls, Ꟶ shuld minyster the Gospell of God, that the offeryng of the gentyls myght be acceptable, Ꟶ sanctified by the holy ghost.
Rom.15.17	I haue therfore wherof I maye reioyse thorow Chryst Iesu, in those thinges which pertayne to God.
Rom.15.18	For I dare not speake of eny of those thynges, whych Chryst hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentyls obedient, with worde and dede,
Rom.15.19	in myghty sygnes Ꟶ wonders, by the power of the sprete of God: so that from Ierusalem Ꟶ the coastes rounde aboute vnto Illyrycum, I haue fylled all countres with the Gospell of Christ.
Rom.15.20	So haue I enforsed my selfe to preache the Gospell, not where Chryst was named, lest I shulde haue bylt on another mannes foundacyon:
Rom.15.21	but as it is written. To whom he was not spoken of, they shall se: Ꟶ they that hearde not, shall vnderstande.
Rom.15.22	For this cause I haue bene ofte let that I could not come vnto you:
Rom.15.23	but nowe, seynge I haue nomore to do in these countrees, and also haue bene desyrous many yeares to come vnto you,
Rom.15.24	whensoeuer I take my iorney into spayne, I wyll come to you. For I trust to se you in my iorney, and to be brought on my waye thither warde by you, after that I haue somwhat enioyed your acquaintaunce.
Rom.15.25	Now go I vnto Ierusalem, and minister vnto the saynctes.
Rom.15.26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certayne distribucyon vpon the poore saynctes, whych are at Ierusalem.
Rom.15.27	It hath pleased them verely, and their detters are they. For yf the Gentyls be made partetakers of their spirituall thynges, their dutie is to minyster vnto them in bodyly thinges.
Rom.15.28	When I haue performed this, and haue brought them this frute sealed, I wyll come backe agayne by you into Spayne.
Rom.15.29	I am sure that when I come vnto you I shall come with aboundaunce of the blessynge of the Gospell of Chryst.
Rom.15.30	I beseche you brethren for oure Lord Iesus Christes sake, and for the loue of the sprete, that ye helpe me in my busynes with youre prayers to God for me,
Rom.15.31	that I maye be delyuered from them which beleue not in Iewry: Ꟶ that this my seruice, which I haue to do at Ierusalem, maye be accepted of the saynctes,
Rom.15.32	that I maye come vnto you with ioye, by the will of God, and maye with you be refresshed.
Rom.15.33	The God of peace be wyth you all. Amen.
Rom.16.1	I commende vnto you Phebe, oure syster (which is a minyster of the congregacion of Cenchrea)
Rom.16.2	that ye receaue her in Christ, as it becommeth sainctes, and that ye assyst her in what soeuer busynes she neadeth of youre ayde. For she hath suckered many, and myne awne selfe also.

Rom.16.17	I beseche you brethren, marke them which cause diuisyon Ꟶ geue occasions of euyll, contrary to the doctrine, which ye haue learned: Ꟶ auoyde them.
Rom.16.18	For they that are suche, serue not the Lorde Iesus Christ, but their awne bellyes, Ꟶ with swete and flatterynge wordes, deceaue the hertes of the innocentes.
Rom.16.19	For your obedience is gone abroade vnto all men. I am glad therfore no dout, of you. But yet I wolde haue you wyse vnto that which is good, Ꟶ to be innocente as concernynge euyll.
Rom.16.20	The God of peace shall treade Satan vnder youre fete shortly. The grace of oure Lorde Iesu Christ be with you.

Rom.16.26	but now is opened by the scriptures of the prophetes at the commaundement of the euerlastynge God, to stere vp obedience to the fayth, publysshed amonge all nacions:
