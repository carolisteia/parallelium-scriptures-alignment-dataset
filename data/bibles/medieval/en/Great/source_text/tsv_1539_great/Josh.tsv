Josh.0.0	¶ The seconde parte of the Byble
Josh.0.0	¶ The boke of Iosua whom the the Hebrues call Iehosua.
Josh.1.1	After the death of Moses the seruaunt of the Lorde, it happened also that the Lorde spake vnto Iosua the sonne of Nun Moses minister saying:
Josh.1.2	Moses my seruaunt is deed. Now therfore vp Ꟶ goo ouer Iordan: thou Ꟶ all this people, vnto the lande the whych I geue vnto the children of Israel.
Josh.1.3	All the places that the sooles of youre fete shall treade vpon, haue I geuen you, as I sayde vnto Moses:
Josh.1.4	from the wildernes Ꟶ this Libanon vnto the greate ryuer Euphrates: all the lande of the Hethites, euen vnto the great see towarde the going downe of the sonne, shalbe youre coaste.
Josh.1.5	There shall not a man be able to withstande that all the dayes of thy lyfe. For as I was with Moses, so will I be with the and will not fayll the, nor forsake the.
Josh.1.6	Be strong therfore and bolde: for vnto this people shalt thou deuyde the lande which I sware vnto their fathers to geue them.
Josh.1.7	Onely be thou strong Ꟶ as bolde as thou canst, that thou mayest obserue Ꟶ do according to all the lawe, which Moses my seruaunt commaunded the. Tourne therfrom nether to the right hand, nor to the lefte: that thou mayste do wysely in all thou takest in hande:
Josh.1.8	let not the boke of this lawe departe out of thy mouthe: But recorde therin daye Ꟶ night that thou mayst obserue, Ꟶ do according to all that is written therin. For then shalt thou make thy waye prosperouse, and then thou shalt do wysely.
Josh.1.9	Haue not I commaunded the, that thou shuldest be stronge Ꟶ hardye Ꟶ not feare ner be faynt harted? For I the Lord thy God am with the, whether soeuer thou goest.
Josh.1.10	Then Iosua commaunded the officers of the people, sayinge:
Josh.1.11	Goo thorowe the myddes of the hoste, Ꟶ comaunde the people, saying: prepare you vitayles: for after thre dayes ye shall passe ouer this Iordan, to goo in Ꟶ enioye the lande which the Lord youre God geueth you, to possesse it.
Josh.1.12	And vnto the Rubenites, Gadites, Ꟶ half the trybe of Manasses spake Iosua saying:
Josh.1.13	Remember the worde, which Moses the seruaunt of the Lorde commaunded you, sayinge: the Lorde youre God hathe geuen you reast, Ꟶ hathe geuen you this land.
Josh.1.14	Youre wyues, youre children, and youre catell shall remayne in the lande which Moses gaue you on this syde Iordan: But ye shall go before youre brethren armyd, all that be men of warre, and helpe them
Josh.1.15	vntill the Lorde haue geuen youre brethren reast, as he hathe you, and vntill they also haue obtayned the lande, which the Lorde youre God geueth them. And then shall ye retourne vnto the lande of youre possession Ꟶ enioye it, which lande Moses the Lordes seruaunt gaue you on this syde Iordan towarde the sonne rysynge.
Josh.1.16	And they answered Iosua sayinge: All that thou hast commaunded vs, we will do, and whether soeuer thou sendest vs, we wyll go.
Josh.1.17	According as we obeyed Moses in all thinges, so wyll we obeye the: onlye the Lorde thy God be with the as he was with Moses.
Josh.1.18	And whosoeuer he be that doth dysobeye thy mouth, and will not herken vnto thy wordes in all that thou commaundest him, let him dye: Onlye be strong and of good courage.
Josh.2.1	And Iosua the sonne of Nun sent out of Settim two men to spye secretlye, sayinge: go Ꟶ vewe the lande and also Iericho. And they went, and came into a harlotes house, named Rahab, Ꟶ lodged there.
Josh.2.2	And it was tolde the kynge of Iericho, and sayd: Beholde, there came men in hyther to nyght, of the children of Israel, to spye out the countrey.
Josh.2.3	And the kyng of Iericho sent vnto Rahab saying: brynge forth the men that are come to the, Ꟶ which are entred into thyne house: for they be come to searche out all the lande.
Josh.2.4	And the woman toke the two men Ꟶ hid them. And sayde thus: in dede there came men vnto me, but I wist not whence they were.
Josh.2.5	And aboute the tyme of the shuttynge of the gate when it was darcke, the men went out, whether the men went I wot not: folowe ye after them quycklye, Ꟶ ye shall ouer take them.
Josh.2.6	But she brought them vp to the rooffe of the house, and hydd them wt the stalckes of flaxe, which she had lyinge abroade vpon the rooffe.
Josh.2.7	And the men of the cytye pursued after them, the waye to Iordan, euen vnto the ferie, and as sone as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shutt the gate.
Josh.2.8	And or euer they were a slepe, she came vp vnto them vpon the rooffe,
Josh.2.9	Ꟶ sayde vnto the men: I knowe, that the Lorde hathe geuen you the lande for the feare of you is fallen vpon vs, Ꟶ the enhabiters of the land faynt at the presence of you.
Josh.2.10	For we haue heard, how the Lorde dried vp the water of the redd see before you when you came out of Egypte, Ꟶ what you dyd vnto the two kynges of the Amorites, that were on the other side Iordan Sehon, Ꟶ Og, whom ye vtterlye destroyed.
Josh.2.11	And as sone as we had heard these thynges oure hertes dyd fainte. And there remayned no moare courage in any man at the presence of you. For the Lord youre God, he is the God in heauen aboue, Ꟶ on the erth benethe.
Josh.2.12	Now therfore (I pray you) sweare vnto me by the Lorde, that as I haue shewed you mercie, ye shall also shewe mercie vnto my fathers house, Ꟶ geue me a true token.
Josh.2.13	And that ye shall saue alyue, bothe my father, Ꟶ my mother, my brethren, Ꟶ my systers, and all that they haue. And that ye shall delyuer oure soules from death.
Josh.2.14	And the men answered her: oure liues for you to dye, yf ye vtter not this oure busines. And when the Lord hathe geuen vs the land, we will deale mercifully Ꟶ truly with the.
Josh.2.15	And then she lett them downe by a coarde, thorow a windowe: For her house was by the towne wall. And she dwelt by the towne wall.
Josh.2.16	And she sayd vnto them: gett you into the mountayne, lest the pursuers mete you, Ꟶ hyde youre selues there thre dayes, vntill the pursuars be returned and then shall ye goo youre awne waye.
Josh.2.17	And the men sayde vnto her: we will be blamelesse of this thy othe, which thou hast made vs sweare.
Josh.2.18	Beholde, when we come into the lande, thou shalt bynde this purple coarde in the window, which thou lattest vs downe bye. And thou shalt bring thy father, Ꟶ thy mother, thy brethren, and all thy fathers houshold, euen into thy house.
Josh.2.19	And then whosoeuer doth go out at the dores of thy house, into the streat, his bloude shalbe vpon his awne head, Ꟶ we wilbe giltlesse. And whosoeuer shalbe with the in the house, hys bloude shall be on oure heade, yf any mannes hande touche him:
Josh.2.20	And yf thou vtter these oure wordes, we wilbe quyte of thy othe, which thou hast made vs sweare.
Josh.2.21	And she sayde: accordinge vnto youre wordes, so be it: and she sent them awaye to departe. And she bounde the purple coarde in the window.
Josh.2.22	And they departed, and came into the mountayne, and there aboade thre dayes, vntill the pursuars were returned. And the pursuars sought them thorowe out all the waye but founde them not.
Josh.2.23	And the two men returned, Ꟶ descended from the mountayne, and passed ouer, and came to Iosua the sonne of Nun, and tolde hym all that had chaunced them.
Josh.2.24	And they sayd vnto Iosua: the Lord truly hathe delyuered into oure handes all the lande, and all the inhabiters of the contrey faynte at the presence of vs.
Josh.3.1	And Iosua rose erlye: and they remoued from Settim, Ꟶ came to Iordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there, before they went ouer.
Josh.3.2	And after thre dayes it fortuned, that the officers went thorow out the hoste,
Josh.3.3	and commaunded the people sayinge: when ye se the arcke of the testament of the Lord youre God, Ꟶ the preastes that are Leuites bearing it: ye shall departe from youre place, Ꟶ go after it.
Josh.3.4	So yet that there shall be a space betwene you Ꟶ it, aboute a two thousande cubites by measure. And ye shal not come nye vnto it, that ye maye knowe the waye, by which ye must go: for ye haue not gone this waye in tymes past
Josh.3.5	And Iosua sayd vnto the people: Sanctifie youre selues, for tomorowe the Lorde shall do wonders amonge you.
Josh.3.6	And Iosua spake vnto the preastes, saying: Take vp the arcke of the couenaunt: Ꟶ go before the people. And they toke vp the arcke of the testament, and went before the people.
Josh.3.7	And the Lorde sayde vnto Iosua: this daye will I begynne to magnifie the, in the syght of all Israel, that they maye knowe how that as I was with Moses so wyll I be with the.
Josh.3.8	And thou shalt commaunde the preastes that beare the arcke of the couenaunt saying: when ye are come to the edge of the waters of Iordan, ye shall stande still in it.
Josh.3.9	And Iosua sayde vnto the children of Israel: come hither, Ꟶ heare the wordes of the Lord youre God.
Josh.3.10	And Iosua sayde, Herbye ye shall knowe that the liuyng God is among you, Ꟶ that he will wythout fayle cast out before you, the Cananites, Ꟶ the Hethites, the Heuites, the Pheresites, the Gergesites, the Amorites, Ꟶ the Iebusites.
Josh.3.11	Beholde, the arcke of the apointment of the Lord of all the worlde goeth before you into Iordan.
Josh.3.12	Now therfore take from amonge you twelue men out of the tribes of Israel, out of euery tribe a man.
Josh.3.13	And as sone as the sooles of the fete of the preasts (that beare the arcke of the Lord the Gouernour of all the world) tread in the waters of Iordan, the waters of Iordan shall be deuided: Ꟶ the waters that come from aboue, shall stande still vpon an heape.
Josh.3.14	And it fortuned, that when the people were departed from their tentes to goo ouer Iordan, the preastes bearyng the arcke of the appointment, went before the people.
Josh.3.15	And as sone as they that bare the arcke came vnto Iordan, Ꟶ the fete of the preastes that bare the arcke were dipped in the brym of the water (For Iordan vseth to fill all hys banckes all the tyme of haruest)
Josh.3.16	the waters also that came downe from aboue, did ryse vp vpon an heape and departed farre from Adam, that was besyde zarthan, And the waters that were beneth to ward the see of the wildernes, fell awaye Ꟶ departed into the salt see, and the people went ryght ouer agaynst Iericho,
Josh.3.17	And the preastes that bare the arcke of the appointement of the Lorde, stoode drye within Iordane ready prepared, Ꟶ all the Israelites went ouer thorow the drye, vntill all the people were gone cleane ouer thorow Iordan,
Josh.4.1	And it fortuned, that whan the people. were all gone ouer Iordan, the Lorde spake vnto Iosua, sayinge:
Josh.4.2	Take you twelue men out of the people, out of euery trybe a man. And commaunde you them, sayinge: take you hence out of the myddes of Iordan
Josh.4.3	(euen out of the place where the preastes stoode in a redynes) twelue stones, which ye shall take awaye with you, and leaue them in the place, where you shal lodge this night.
Josh.4.4	And Iosua called the twelue men, which he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of euery trybe a man,
Josh.4.5	and Iosua sayde vnto them: gett you before the arcke of the Lord youre God, euen thorow the myddes of Iordan and take vp euery man of you a stone vpon his shulder, according vnto the nombre of the trybes of the children of Israel,
Josh.4.6	that this maye be a signe among you. That when youre children aske thier fathers in tyme to come, sayinge: what meane these stones with you?
Josh.4.7	Ye maye answere them how that the waters of Iordan deuyded at the presence of the arcke of the appoyntement of the Lorde. For whan it went ouer Iordan, the waters of Iordan deuided: And these stones are become a memoriall vnto the children of Israel for euer.
Josh.4.8	And the children of Israel dyd euen so as Iosua commaunded, and toke vp twelue stones out of the myddes of Iordan, as the Lorde sayde vnto Iosua, accordynge to the nombre of the tribes of the children of Israel, Ꟶ caryed them awaye with them vnto the place where they lodged, Ꟶ layed them doune there.
Josh.4.9	And Iosua set vp twelue stones also in the myddes of Iordan, in the place where the fete of the preastes which bare the arcke of the testament, stode. And there haue they continued vnto this daye.
Josh.4.10	For the preastes which bare the arcke stode in the myddes of Iordan, vntill all was finisshed that the Lorde commaunded Iosua to saye vnto the people, according to all that Moses charged Iosua. And the people hasted, and went ouer.
Josh.4.11	It fortuned also, that whan all the people were cleane ouer, the arke of the Lord went ouer also, Ꟶ the preastes before the people.
Josh.4.12	And the children of Ruben, Ꟶ the children of Gad, Ꟶ halfe the tribe of Manasses went before the children of Israel armed, as Moses charged them.
Josh.4.13	Euen fourty thousande prepared for warre, went before the Lorde vnto battell, thorow the playne of Iericho.
Josh.4.14	That daye the Lorde magnified Iosua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses all dayes of his lyfe.
Josh.4.15	And the Lord spake vnto Iosua, saying:
Josh.4.16	commaunde the preastes that beare the arcke of witnesse, to come vp out of Iordan.
Josh.4.17	Iosua therfore commaunded the preastes, saying: Come ye vp out of Iordan,
Josh.4.18	And when the preastes that bare the arcke of the apoyntment of the Lorde were come vp out of the myddes of Iordan, and as sone as the soales of the preastes fete were set on the drye land, the waters of Iordan retourned agayne vnto their place, Ꟶ went ouer all their banckes, as they dyd before.
Josh.4.19	And the people came vp out of Iordan the tenth daye of the fyrst moneth, and pitched in Gilgal, euen in the east border of the cyte Iericho.
Josh.4.20	And the twelue stones which they toke out of Iordan, did Iosua pitche in Gilgal
Josh.4.21	And he spake vnto the children of Israel, saying: Yf youre children aske their fathers in tyme to come, Ꟶ saye: what meane these stones?
Josh.4.22	ye shal shewe youre children, Ꟶ saye: Israel came ouer this Iordan on drie land.
Josh.4.23	For the Lord youre God dryed vp the water of Iordan before you, vntill ye were gone ouer, as the Lorde youre God dyd the red see which he dryed vp before vs, tyll we were gone ouer:
Josh.4.24	that all the people of the worlde maye knowe the hande of the Lord, how myghtie it is, and that ye might feare the Lord youre God for euer.
Josh.5.1	And it fortuned that when all the kinges of the Amorites which are beyond Iordan west warde, Ꟶ all the kinges of the Cananites which were by the see, hearde, how the Lorde had dryed vp the waters of Iordan before the children of Israel, vntill they wer gone ouer theyr hertes fainted for feare. And ther was no sprete in them any moare, for the presence of the children of Israel.
Josh.5.2	That same tyme the Lorde sayde vnto Iosua: Make the sharpe knyues (of stone) Ꟶ goo to agayne and circumcise the children of Israel the seconde tyme.
Josh.5.3	And Iosua made him sharpe knyues (of stone) Ꟶ circuncised the children of Israel in the place called the hille of the foreskynnes.
Josh.5.4	And this is the cause why Iosua circucised all the people that came out of Egipte: Namely such as were males because that all the men of warre, died in the wildernes by the waye, after they came out of Egypte.
Josh.5.5	For all the people that came out were circumcised. But all the people that were borne in the wildernesse by the waye after they came out of Egypte, were not circumcised.
Josh.5.6	For the children of Israel walked fourty yeres in the wildernesse, tyll all the people of the men of warre that came out of Egipte were consumed, because they harkened not vnto the voyce of the Lorde. Wherfore the Lorde sware, that he wolde not shewe them the land which the Lord sware vnto theyr fathers, that he wolde geue vs, euen a lande that floweth wyth milke Ꟶ honye.
Josh.5.7	And their children whom he sett vp in their stead: them Iosua circumcised: for they were vncircumcised, because they circumcised them not by the waye.
Josh.5.8	And when they had circumcised all the people, they abode styll together in the hoste till they were whole.
Josh.5.9	And the Lorde sayde vnto Iosua: this daye I haue taken awaye the shame of Egipte from you: wherfore the name of the same place is called Gilgal vnto this daye.
Josh.5.10	And the children of Israel abode in Gilgall and helde the feast of passeouer the fourtene daye of the moneth at euen in the playne of Ierico.
Josh.5.11	And they did eat of the corne of the land on the morowe after passeouer swete cakes Ꟶ parched corne in the selfe same daye.
Josh.5.12	For the Manna ceased on the morowe, after they had begonne to eat of the corne of the lande, nether had the children of Israel Manna any moare, but dyd eat of the corne of the lande of Canaan that yere.
Josh.5.13	And it fortuned that when Iosua was nye to Iericho, he lyfte vp his eyes Ꟶ loked: and behold, there stode a man against him, hauyng a swerde drawen in his hande. And Iosua went vnto him, and sayde vnto him: arte thou on oure syde or on oure aduersaries.
Josh.5.14	And he sayde, Naye, but as a captayne of the hoste of the lord am I now come. And Iosua fell on his face to the erth, and dyd reuerence, Ꟶ sayde vnto hym, what sayth my Lorde vnto hys seruaunt?
Josh.5.15	And the captayne of the Lordes hoste sayde vnto Iosua: do thy shoo of thy fote, for the place wheron thou standest, is holy. And Iosua did so.
Josh.6.1	And Iericho was shut vp, Ꟶ locked because of the children of Israel, nether myght anye man go out or in.
Josh.6.2	And the Lord sayd vnto Iosua: beholde, I haue geuen into thyne hand Iericho and her kynge and the strong men of warre.
Josh.6.3	And ye shall compasse the cytie, all ye that be men of warre, Ꟶ go rounde aboute it once and so shall you do syxe dayes.
Josh.6.4	And seuen preastes shall beare before the Arke, seuen trompettes of rammes hornes. And the seuenth daye, ye shal compasse the cytie seuen tymes, and the preastes shall blowe with the trompettes.
Josh.6.5	And when they make a longe blaste wyth the rammes horne, Ꟶ ye heare the sounde of the horne, all the people shal showte wt a great showte. And then shall the wall of the citie fall doune, and the people shall ascende vp, euery man streight before him.
Josh.6.6	And Iosua the sonne of Nun, called the preastes, and sayde vnto them: take vp the arcke of the appointement, Ꟶ lett seuen preastes beare seuen trompettes of rammes hornes before the arcke of the Lorde,
Josh.6.7	And he sayde vnto the people, go and compasse the cytie: and lett him that is harnessed, go before the arcke of the Lorde.
Josh.6.8	And when Iosua had spoken vnto the people, the seuen preastes bare the seuen trompettes of rammes hornes, and went forth before the arcke of the Lorde, Ꟶ blewe with the trompettes, and the arcke of the couenaunt of the Lorde folowed them.
Josh.6.9	And all the men of armes went before the Preastes, that blewe with the trompettes, and the commen people came after the arke: and the prestes that went blewe with trompettes.
Josh.6.10	And Iosua commaunded the people sayinge: Ye shall not showte, ner make any noyse wt youre voyce, neither shal any worde procede out of youre mouthe, vntill the daye I bid you showte, then shall ye showte.
Josh.6.11	And so the arcke of the Lord compased the cytie, and went aboute it once: and they retourned into the hoste, and lodged there.
Josh.6.12	And Iosua rose erly in the mornyng, and the Preastes toke vp the arcke of the Lorde,
Josh.6.13	and seuen Preastes bare seuen trompettes of rammes hornes, Ꟶ went before the arcke of the Lorde, and blew with the trompettes. And all the men of armes went before them, but the comen people came after the arcke of the Lorde, which went before with the blowing of the trompettes.
Josh.6.14	And the seconde daye they compased the cytie once, Ꟶ retourned agayne into the hoste, Ꟶ so they dyd sixe dayes.
Josh.6.15	And when the seuenth daye came, they rose erlye: euen with the dawninge of the daye, and compased the cytie after the same maner seuen tymes: only that daye they compased the cytie seuen tymes.
Josh.6.16	And at the seuenth tyme, whan the preastes blewe wt the trompettes, Iosua sayd vnto the people: showt, for the Lorde hath geuen you the cytie.
Josh.6.17	And the cytie shalbe damned bothe it and all that are therin, vnto the Lorde: onlye Rahab the harlot shall lyue, and all that are with her in the house, because she hidd the messengers that we sent.
Josh.6.18	And in anywise be ye ware of the excommunicate thinges, lest ye make youre selues excommunicate, Ꟶ take of the excommunicate thinges, and make the hoste of Israel excommunicate and trouble it.
Josh.6.19	But all the siluer, golde, vesselles of brasse, Ꟶ yron shalbe consecrate vnto the Lorde, Ꟶ shal come into his treasurie.
Josh.6.20	And the people showted, and blewe wyth trompettes. And when the people heard the sounde of the trompe, they showted wt a great showt: Ꟶ the wall fell downe, so that the people went vp into the cytie, euery man streyght before him,
Josh.6.21	Ꟶ toke the citie. And they vtterly destroyed all that was in the cytie, bothe man and woman, younge and olde, oxe, shepe Ꟶ Asse, with the edge of the swerde.
Josh.6.22	Then Iosua sayde vnto the two men that had spyed out the contreye: goo into the harlottes house, and bringe out thense the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware to her,
Josh.6.23	And the younge men that were spyes, went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father and mother and her brethren, and all that she had. And they brought out all her kinred, Ꟶ put them without the hoste of Israel
Josh.6.24	And they burnt the cytie with fier, and all that was therin. Only the siluer and the golde, the vessels of brasse and yron, they put vnto the treasure of the house of the Lord
Josh.6.25	And Iosua saued Rahab the harlott, Ꟶ her fathers housholde, and all that she had, Ꟶ she dwelt in Israel, euen vnto this daye because she hidd the messengers, which Iosua sent to spye out Iericho.
Josh.6.26	And Iosua sware at that tyme, sayinge: cursed be the man before the Lorde, that riseth vp, Ꟶ bildeth this citie Iericho: he shall laye the foundacion in his eldest sonne, and in his youngest sonne shal he sett vp the gates of it.
Josh.6.27	And so the Lord was wt Iosua, and his fame was noysed thorowe out all landes.
Josh.7.1	But yet the children of Israel trespased in the excommunicate thynges: And Acan the sonne of Carmy, the sonne of zabdi, the sonne of zareh of the tribe of Iuda, toke of the excommunicat thinges. And the wrath of the Lorde waxed whote agaynst the children of Israel.
Josh.7.2	And Iosua sent men from Iericho to Hai, which is besyde Bethauen, on the east syde of Bethel, Ꟶ spake vnto them, sayinge: gett you vp, Ꟶ vewe the countrey. And the men went vp, Ꟶ spyed out Hai.
Josh.7.3	And retourned to Iosua, and sayde vnto him, lett not all the people go vp, but let as it were a two or thre thousande men goo vp, and smyte Hai and make not all the people to laboure thether, for they are but fewe.
Josh.7.4	And so there went vp thether of the people, aboute a thre thousande men, Ꟶ they fledd before the men of Hai.
Josh.7.5	And the men of Hai smote of them vpon a thyrtye and sixe men: for they chased them from before the gate euen vnto Sebarim, Ꟶ smote them in the goyng doune. Wherfore the hertes of the people for feare melted awaye like water.
Josh.7.6	And Iosua rent his clothes, and fell to the erth vpon his face before the arcke of the Lorde vntill the euen tyde, he and the elders of Israel, Ꟶ put erth vpon their heddes.
Josh.7.7	And Iosua sayde Alas, O Lorde God, wherfore hast thou brought thys people ouer Iordan, to diliuer vs into the hande of the Amorites, and to destroie vs: wold to God we had bene content, Ꟶ dwelt on the other syde Iordan.
Josh.7.8	Oh Lorde what shall I saye, when Israel turneth their backes before their enemyes:
Josh.7.9	Surely the Cananites, and all the enhabiters of the lande shall heare of it, Ꟶ shall conspire agaynst vs, Ꟶ destroye the name of vs out of the worlde. And what wilt thou do vnto thy myghtie name?
Josh.7.10	And the Lorde sayde vnto Iosua, gett the vp, wherfore lyest thou thus vpon thy face?
Josh.7.11	Israel hath synned, Ꟶ they haue transgressed myne appointement, which I commaunded them: for they haue taken of the excommunicate thinges, and haue stolen, and dissembled, Ꟶ put them vnto their awne stuffe
Josh.7.12	And therfore is it that the children of Israel cannot stande before their ennemyes, but shall turne their backes before their ennemyes because they be excommunicate. Nether will I be wt you any moare, excepte ye rote out the excommunicate from amonge you.
Josh.7.13	Up therfore, Ꟶ sanctifie the people, and saye: sanctifie youre selues against to morowe: for so sayd the Lord God of Israel There is a damned thinge amonge you (O Israel) Ꟶ therfore ye cannot stande against youre ennemyes, vntill ye haue put the damned thinge from amonge you.
Josh.7.14	Tomorowe morning therfore ye shall be brought according to youre tribes. And the tribe which the Lord taketh, shal come according to the kynreds therof. And the kynred which the Lord shall finde gyltie, shall come by housholders And the housholde which the Lord shall finde fautye, shall come man by man.
Josh.7.15	And he that is founde in the excommunicacion, shalbe burnt with fire, he and all that he hath, because he hath transgressed the couenaunt of the Lord and wrought folye in Israell.
Josh.7.16	And so Iosua rose vp erly in the morning and brought Israell by their tribes: and the tribe of Iuda was caught.
Josh.7.17	And he brought the kynredes of Iuda, and toke the kynred of the zarehites. And he brought the kynred of the zarehites, man, by man, Ꟶ zabdi was caught.
Josh.7.18	And he brought his housholde man by man, and Acan the sonne of Carmy, the sonne of zabdi, the sonne of zareth in the tribe of Iuda was caught.
Josh.7.19	And Iosua sayde vnto Acan: my sonne, I beseche the, geue glorie to the Lord God of Israell, Ꟶ geue him praise, Ꟶ shewe me what thou hast done, hyde it not from me.
Josh.7.20	And Acan answered Iosua, Ꟶ sayde: of a truthe I haue synned agaynst the Lorde God of Israell, Ꟶ thus Ꟶ thus haue I done.
Josh.7.21	I sawe among the spoyle a goodlye Babylonishe garment, Ꟶ two hundred sicles of siluer, Ꟶ a tonge of golde of fyftie sicles weyghte, and I coueted them, Ꟶ toke them. And beholde, they lye hydde in the erthe in my tente and the siluer is ther vnder.
Josh.7.22	And so Iosua sent messengers: which whan they ranne vnto his tent, beholde, they were hid in his tent, and the syluer there vnder.
Josh.7.23	Therfore they toke them out of the myddest of his tent, and brought them vnto Iosua, and vnto all the children of Israell, Ꟶ layed them out before the Lorde.
Josh.7.24	And Iosua toke Acan the sonne of zareh, and the siluer, Ꟶ the garment, and the tonge of golde, and his sonnes Ꟶ his daughters, his oxen, Ꟶ his asses, his shepe, Ꟶ his tent, Ꟶ all that he had: and all Israell wyth hym brought them vnto the valeye of Acor.
Josh.7.25	And Iosua sayde: In as moche as thou haste troubled vs, the Lord shall trouble the this daye. And all Israell stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire,
Josh.7.26	and ouerwhelmed them with stones. And they cast vpon him a great heape of stones vnto this daye. And so the Lorde turned from the wrathe of his indignacion. And the name of the place is called the valeye of Acor vnto this daye.
Josh.8.1	And the Lorde sayde vnto Iosua: feare not, nether be thou faynt harted. Take all the men of warre wyth the and vp, and gett the to Hai, Beholde, I haue geuen into thy hande, the kyng of Hai, and his people, hys cytie and hys lande.
Josh.8.2	And thou shalt do to Hai Ꟶ her kyng, as thou dydest vnto Iericho and her kyng, Neuerthelesse the spoyle and catell therof, shall ye take vnto youre selues: And laye a watch vnto the towne, on the backsyde therof.
Josh.8.3	And so Iosua arose, and all the men of warre, to go vp agaynst Hai. And Iosua chose oute thyrtie thousande stronge men of warre, Ꟶ sent them a waye by nyght.
Josh.8.4	And he commaunded them, sayinge: beholde, ye shall lye awayte vnto the towne on the backesyde therof. Go not very farre from the cytie, but be all readye.
Josh.8.5	And I and all the people that are with me, will approche vnto the cytie. And when they come out agaynst vs, as they did at the first tyme then will we flee before them.
Josh.8.6	For they will come oute after vs Ꟶ we will bring them out of the cytie. For they will saye: they flee before vs, as at the first tyme:
Josh.8.7	Ꟶ we will flee before them. In the meane tyme shall ye ryse vp from lying awayte, Ꟶ destroye the cytie: For the Lorde youre God will deliuer it into youre hande.
Josh.8.8	And whan ye haue taken the cytie, ye shall set it on fire. Accordinge to the commaundement of the Lord shal ye do: beholde, I haue charged you.
Josh.8.9	Iosua therfore sent them forth, Ꟶ they went to lye awayte, Ꟶ abode betwene Bethel and Hai, on the west syde of the cite of Hai. But Iosua lodged that nyght amonge the people.
Josh.8.10	And Iosua rose vp erlye in the mornynge, and nombred the people, Ꟶ went vp, he Ꟶ the elders of Israel before the people agaynst Hai.
Josh.8.11	And all the men of warre that were with him, went vp and drue nye, and came agaynst the cytie, and pitched on the north syde of Hai, Ꟶ there was a valeye betwene them and Hai.
Josh.8.12	And he toke vpon a fyue thousande men, and put them to lye awayte, betwene Bethel Ꟶ Hai, on the westsyde of the cytie.
Josh.8.13	And they put the people (euen all the hoste that were on the northsyde) agaynst the cytie, and the lyers awayte on the west. And Iosua walked the same nyght in the myddes of the valeye.
Josh.8.14	And it fortuned, that when the kyng of Hai sawe it they hasted and rose vp earlye, and the men of the cytie went oute agaynst Israell to battell, he Ꟶ all his people, at a tyme apoynted, euen before the playne, and wist not that there were lyers awayte on the backsyde of the cytie.
Josh.8.15	And Iosua Ꟶ all Israel fayned them selues to be put to the worsse before them, Ꟶ fled towarde the wildernesse.
Josh.8.16	And all the people of the towne were called together, to folowe after them. And they folowed after Iosua Ꟶ were drawen a waye from the cytie:
Josh.8.17	And there was not a man left in Hai Ꟶ in Bethel, that went not out after Israell. And they left the cytie open, Ꟶ folowed after Israell.
Josh.8.18	And the Lorde sayde vnto Iosua: stretch out the spere that is in thine hand, towarde Hai, for I will geue it into thy hand. And Iosua stretched out the spere that he had in his hande, towarde the citie.
Josh.8.19	And the lyers awayte rose quicklye oute of their place, Ꟶ ranne assone as Iosua had stretched oute his hande, and they entred into the citie and toke it, Ꟶ hasted, Ꟶ sett the cite on fire.
Josh.8.20	And when the men of Hai loked backe after them, they sawe the smoke of the citie assende vp to heauen. And they had no leysure to flee ether thys waye or that, Ꟶ the people that fledd to the wyldernesse, turned backe agayne vpon the folowers.
Josh.8.21	And when Iosua Ꟶ all Israel sawe that the lyers awayte had taken the citie, Ꟶ that the smoke of it ascended, they turned agayne and layed on the men of Hai.
Josh.8.22	And the other yssued oute of the citie agaynst them. And so were they in the middes of Israel: for these were on the one syde of them, Ꟶ the reste on the other syde. And they layed vpon them, so that they lett none of them skape, nor remayne.
Josh.8.23	And the kyng of Hai they toke alyue, Ꟶ brought hym to Iosua.
Josh.8.24	And when Israell had made an ende of slaying all the enhabiters of Hai in the felde of the wyldernesse, where they chased them, Ꟶ when they were all fallen on the edge of the swerde, vntyll they were wasted, all the Israelites returned vnto Hai, Ꟶ smote it in the edge of the swerde,
Josh.8.25	And all that fell that daye, both of men Ꟶ wemen, were twelue thousande, euen all the men of Hai.
Josh.8.26	For Iosua plucked not hys hand backe agayne, which he stretched oute vpon the spere, vntyll he had vtterlye destroyed all the enhabitatoures of Hai.
Josh.8.27	Only the catell and the spoyle of the citie, Israel toke vnto them selues, according vnto the worde of the Lorde, which he commaunded Iosua.
Josh.8.28	And Iosua sett Hai on fyre, and made it an heape for euer, and a wyldernesse, euen vnto thys daye.
Josh.8.29	And the kyng of Hai he hanged on tree, vntyll euen. And assone as the sonne was downe, Iosua commaunded that they shulde take the carkas doune of the tree, and caste it at the entering of the gate of the citie, and laye theron a great heape of stones, that remayneth vnto this daye.
Josh.8.30	Then Iosua bylt an altare vnto the Lorde God of Israell, in mount Eball,
Josh.8.31	as Moses the seruaunt of the Lorde commaunded the children of Israell, and as it is written in the boke of the lawe of Moses: an altare of whole stones, ouer which noman hath lyft any tole of yron. And they sacrifyced theron burnt sacrifyces vnto the Lorde, and offered peace offrynges.
Josh.8.32	And he wrote there vpon the stones, a rehearsall of the lawe of Moses, and wrote it in the presence of the chyldren of Israell.
Josh.8.33	And all Israell and the elders therof, and their officiers Ꟶ Iudges stode, parte on this syde the arcke, Ꟶ parte on that syde, before the Preastes, that were Leuites, which bare the arcke of the apoyntement of the Lorde: as well the straunger, as they that were borne amonge them: halfe on them on the forefronte of the mounte Garizim, and halfe of them on the forefronte of mount Eball: as Moses the seruaunt of the Lorde had commaunded before, that they shulde blesse the people Israell.
Josh.8.34	Afterward he red all the wordes of the lawe, the blessinges and cursynges, according to all that is wrytten in the boke of the lawe:
Josh.8.35	And there was not one worde of all that Moses commaunded, which Iosua read not before all the congregacyon of Israell: The wemen and chyldren, (and the straungers that were come) stondyng amonge them.
Josh.9.1	And it fortuned that when all the kynges that dwell on thys syde Iordan in the hilles and valeys, and alonge by all the coastes of the great see, ouer agaynst Libanon (Namely the Hethites, the Amorites, the Cananites, the Pheresites, the Heuites, and the Iebusytes) herd therof,
Josh.9.2	they gathered them selues together, to fyght agaynst Iosua and agaynst Israell with one accorde.
Josh.9.3	And the enhabitoures of Gibeon heard what Iosua had done vnto Iericho, and to Hai:
Josh.9.4	And they did worke wylylye, Ꟶ went, and made them selues ambasadoures, and toke olde sackes vpon their Asses, and wyne bottelles olde, and rent and worne,
Josh.9.5	and olde clouted shoes vpon their fete, and their rayment was olde, and all their prouysion of bread was dyred vp, and hored,
Josh.9.6	And they came vnto Iosua into the hoste, to Gilgall, and sayde vnto him and vnto all the men of Israell: we be come from a farre contreye, and now make ye agrement with vs.
Josh.9.7	And the men of Israell sayde vnto the Heuite: paraduenture thou dwellest amonge vs, and then howe can I make peace wyth the?
Josh.9.8	And they sayde vnto Iosua: we are thy seruauntes. And Iosua sayde vnto them agayne: what are ye? and whence come ye?
Josh.9.9	They answered him: From a verye farre contrye thy seruauntes are come, for the name of the Lorde thy God: for we haue heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypte,
Josh.9.10	and all that he dyd to the two kynges of the Amorites that were beyonde Iordan, Sehon kynge of Hesbon, and Og kyng of Basan, which was at Astharoth.
Josh.9.11	Wherfore oure elders and all the enhabytoures of oure contrey spake to vs, sayinge: take vitayles wt you to serue by the waye, Ꟶ go mete them, and saye vnto them: we are youre seruauntes. And now make ye a couenant of peace with vs.
Josh.9.12	Thys oure foode of bread, we toke with vs oute of oure houses whotte, the daye we departed to come vnto you. And now behold, it is dyred vp, and hored.
Josh.9.13	And these bottelles of wyne which we filled, were newe: and se, they be rent. And these oure garmentes and shoes are worne for oldnesse, by the reason of the exceadyng long Iourneye.
Josh.9.14	And the men toke of their vitayles, and counceled not with the mouthe of the Lord.
Josh.9.15	And Iosua made peace wyth them, and made a couenaunt with them, that they shulde be suffred to lyue: Ꟶ the Lordes of the congregacyon sware vnto them.
Josh.9.16	And it fortuned, that thre dayes after they had made peace wyth them, they hearde that they were their neyboures, Ꟶ that they dwelte amonge them.
Josh.9.17	And the chyldren of Israel toke their Iourney, and came vnto their cyties the thyrde daye: and their cyties were Gibeon, Ꟶ Caphira, Beeroth and kariat Iarim.
Josh.9.18	And the children of Israell slewe them not, because the Lordes of the congregacyon had sworne vnto them by the Lorde God of Israell. And all the multitude murmured against the Lordes.
Josh.9.19	But all the Lordes sayde vnto all the congregacyon: we haue sworne vnto them by the Lord God of Israel, Ꟶ therfore we maye not hurte them.
Josh.9.20	But this we wyll do to them: We will lett them lyue, lest wrath be vpon vs, because of the othe which we sware vnto them.
Josh.9.21	And the Lordes sayd vnto them agayne: Let them lyue, and hewe wodd, and drawe water vnto all the congregacion, and they did as the Lordes sayde vnto them.
Josh.9.22	And Iosua sent for them, Ꟶ talked wyth them, and sayde: wherfore haue ye begyled vs, sayeng: We dwell farre from you, whan ye dwell amonge vs?
Josh.9.23	and now are you curssed, Ꟶ there shall not cease to be of you, bond men and hewers of wodd Ꟶ drawers of water for the house of my God.
Josh.9.24	And they aunswered Iosua and sayde: it was tolde thy seruauntes, how that the Lord thy God had commaunded his seruaunt Moses to geue you all the lande, and to destroye all the enhabytoures therof oute of youre syght, Ꟶ therfore we were exceadyng sore afrayed for oure lyues at the presence of you, Ꟶ haue done this thinge,
Josh.9.25	Ꟶ beholde we are in thine hande, as it semeth good Ꟶ ryght in thyne eyes to do vnto vs, so do.
Josh.9.26	And euen so dyd he vnto them, and ridde them oute of the hande of the children of Israel, and they slewe them not.
Josh.9.27	And Iosua made them that same daye hewers of wodd, Ꟶ drawers of water for the congregacyon and for the aulter of God vnto thys daye, in the place which God shulde chose.
Josh.10.1	And it fortuned, that when Adonizedec kyng of Ierusalem had heard how Iosua had taken Hai, Ꟶ had destroyed it, and how that as he had done to Iericho and her kyng, euen so he had done to Hai and her kyng, and how the Inhabitoures of Gibeon had made peace wyth Israell, and were amonge them, they feared excedinglye,
Josh.10.2	for Gibeon was a great cytie, as any cytie of the kyngdome, Ꟶ was greater then Hai, and all the men therof were very myghtye.
Josh.10.3	Wherfore Adonizedec kyng of Ierusalem sent vnto Hoham kyng of Hebron, and vnto Pirea kyng of Iarmuth, Ꟶ vnto Iaphia kyng of Lachis, and vnto Debir kyng of Eglon, saying:
Josh.10.4	Come vp vnto me, Ꟶ healpe me, that we may smyte Gibeon: for they haue made peace with Iosua and wyth the children of Israell.
Josh.10.5	Therfore the .v. kynges of the Amorites, the kyng of Ierusalem, the kyng of Hebron, the kyng of Iarmuth, the kyng of Lachis, the kyng of Eglon geathered them selues to geather, they withall their hostes, Ꟶ beseged Gibeon, and made warre agaynst it.
Josh.10.6	And the men of Gibeon sent vnto Iosua Ꟶ to the hoste to Gilgal, sayinge: withdrawe not thy hande from thy seruauntes, come vp to vs, to saue vs, Ꟶ to helpe vs: For al the kinges of the Amorites which dwell in the mountaynes are geathered togeather against vs.
Josh.10.7	And so Iosua ascended from Gilgall, he and all the people of warre with him, Ꟶ all the men of myghte,
Josh.10.8	and the Lord sayde vnto Iosua, feare them not, for I haue delyuered them into thyne hande. Nether shal any of them stande agaynst the.
Josh.10.9	Iosua therfore came vnto them sodenlye, and went vp from Gilgall all nyght.
Josh.10.10	And the Lord troubled them before Israell, and slewe them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them a longe the waye that gothe vp to Bethoron, and smote them to Esaka Ꟶ Makeda.
Josh.10.11	And it fortuned, that as they fled from Israell, Ꟶ were in the goyng doune to Bethoron, the Lorde cast downe great stones from heauen vpon them, vntyll Esaka. And there were mo deed with hayle stones, then they were, whom the chyldren of Israell slewe wyth the swerde.
Josh.10.12	Then spake Iosua before the Lorde, in the daye when the Lorde delyuered the Amorites before the chyldren of Israell, and he sayde in the syght of Israell. Sonne stande thou still vpon Gibeon, and thou Mone, in Aialon.
Josh.10.13	And the sonne abode, and the mone stode styll, vntyll the people aduenged them selues vpon their enemyes. Is not this written in the boke of the ryghtwes? The sonne (I saye) abode in the myddes of heauen and hasted not to goo doune by that space of a whole daye.
Josh.10.14	And there was no daye lyke that, before it, or after it, that the Lorde heard the voyce of a man. For the Lorde fought for Israell.
Josh.10.15	And Iosua returned and all Israel with hym, vnto the hoste to Gilgall:
Josh.10.16	but the fyue kynges fledde, and were hyd in a caue at Makeda.
Josh.10.17	And it was tolde Iosua of one saying, the fyue kynges are founde hid in a caue which is at Makeda.
Josh.10.18	And Iosua sayd rowle great stones vpon the mouthe of the caue, and set men by it, for to kepe them.
Josh.10.19	And stande ye not stylle, but folowe after youre enemyes, and smyte all the hindmost, And soffre them not to entre into theyr cyties, for the Lorde youre God hath delyuered them into youre hande.
Josh.10.20	And it fortuned, when Iosua and the chyldren of Israell had made an ende of slaying them wyth an excedinge great slaughter tyll they were wasted, the rest that remayned of them, entred into walled cyties.
Josh.10.21	And all the people returned to the hoste, to Iosua at Makeda in peace, neither dyd any man moue hys tong agaynst the chyldren of Israel.
Josh.10.22	Then sayde Iosua: open the mouth of the caue, and bryng oute these .v. kynges vnto me oute of the caue.
Josh.10.23	And they dyd so, and brought those fyue kynges vnto hym, oute of the caue, euen the kynge of Ierusalem, the kyng of Hebron, the kyng of Iarmuth, the kyng of Lachis, and the kynge of Eglon.
Josh.10.24	And it fortuned, that when they brought oute those kynges vnto Iosua: Iosua called for all the men of Israell, and sayde vnto the chefe of the men of warre, which wente with hym: come nere, Ꟶ put youre fete vpon the neckes of these kynges. And they cam neare: and put their fete vpon the neckes of them.
Josh.10.25	And Iosua sayde vnto them: Ye shall not feare, ner be faynt harted. But be strong and plucke vp youre hertes, for thus shall the Lorde do to all youre enemyes agaynst whom ye fyght.
Josh.10.26	And then Iosua smote them, and slewe them, Ꟶ hanged them on fyue trees. And they hanged still vpon the trees vntill the euening.
Josh.10.27	And at the going doune of the sonne it fortuned that Iosua gaue commaundement, and they toke them doune of the trees, and cast them into the caue, (where in they had bene hyd), Ꟶ layed great stones on the caues mouthe, which remayne vnto this daye.
Josh.10.28	And that same daye Iosua toke Makeda, and smote it wyth the edge of the swerde, and the kynge therof also destroyed he vtterly, wyth all the soules that were therin, and let nought remayne. And he dyd to the kynge of Makeda as he dyd to the kynge of Iericho.
Josh.10.29	Then Iosua went from Makeda, and all Israell with hym vnto Libna, Ꟶ fought against Libna.
Josh.10.30	And the Lorde delyuered it and the kynge therof into the hand of Israell, and he smote it wyth the edge of the swerde, and all the soules that were therin. He let nought remayne in it, but dyd vnto the kyng therof as he dyd vnto the kynge of Iericho.
Josh.10.31	And Iosua departed from Libna, and all Israell wyth hym, vnto Lachis, and beseged it, and assaulted it.
Josh.10.32	And the Lord delyuered Lachis into the hande of Israell which toke it the seconde daye, and smote it with the edge of the swerde, Ꟶ all the soules that were therin, doing accordyng to all, as he had done to the cite of Libna.
Josh.10.33	Then Horam kynge of Geser came vp to helpe Lachis: And Iosua smote hym Ꟶ his people, vntill naught remayned of hym.
Josh.10.34	And from Lachis Iosua departed, vnto Eglon, and all Israell with hym, and they beseged it, and assaulted it,
Josh.10.35	and toke it the same daye, and smote it with the edge of the swerde, and all the soules that were therin he vtterlye destroyed the same daye, according to all that he had done to Lachis.
Josh.10.36	And Iosua departed vp from Eglon and all Israel with him, vnto Hebron. And they fought agaynst it,
Josh.10.37	and whan they had taken it, they smote it with the edge of the swerde, and the kyng therof, and all the townes that pertayned to it, and all the soules that were therin, and he lefte nought remayning: but did according to all, as he had done to Eglon, and destroyed it vtterlye, and all the soules that were therin.
Josh.10.38	And Iosua returned, and all Israell with him to Dabir, and fought agaynst it.
Josh.10.39	And whan he had taken it, and the kyng therof, and all the townes that pertayned therto. they smote them with the edge of the swerde, and vtterlye destroyed all the soules that were therin, nether let he ought remayne. Euen as he dyd to Hebron, so he dyd to Dabir and the kyng therof, as he had done also to Libna and her kynge.
Josh.10.40	Iosua therfore smote all the hill contreys, and the southe contreys, and the valeyes, and the hill sydes, Ꟶ all their kynges, Ꟶ lett nought remayne of them, but vtterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lorde God of Israell commaunded.
Josh.10.41	And Iosua smote them from Cades barne vnto Asah, and all the contrey of Gosan, euen vnto Gibeon.
Josh.10.42	All those kynges and their lande dyd Iosua take at one tyme: because the Lorde God of Israell fought for Israell.
Josh.10.43	And Iosua and all Israel returned, vnto the hoste that was in Gilgall.
Josh.11.1	And it fortuned, that when Iabin kyng of Hazor had hearde those thinges: he sent to Iobab kynge of Madon, Ꟶ to the kyng of Simron, and to the kynge of Achsaph,
Josh.11.2	and vnto the kynges that are by northe in the mountaynes, Ꟶ playnes toward the southesyde of Ceneroth, and in the lowe countreys, Ꟶ in the borders of Dor westward
Josh.11.3	and vnto the Cananytes bothe by Easte Ꟶ weste, Ꟶ vnto the Amorites, Hethites, Pheresites, and Iebusites in the mountaynes: Ꟶ vnto the Heuites that were vnder Hermon in the lande of Mizpa:
Josh.11.4	And they came out and all their hostes with them, a multytude of folke, euen as the sande that is on the see shore in a greate nombre with horsses Ꟶ charettes exceding manye.
Josh.11.5	And all these kynges mett together, and came, and pytched together at the waters of Merom, for to fight agaynst Israell.
Josh.11.6	And the Lorde sayde vnto Iosua: be not afrayde at the presence of them: for tomorowe aboute this tyme will I delyuer then all slayne before Israell: thou shalt hough their horsses, Ꟶ burne their charettes with fire.
Josh.11.7	And so Iosua came and all the men of warre with hym agaynst them by the waters of Merom, Ꟶ sodenlye fell vpon them.
Josh.11.8	And the Lorde delyuered them into the hande of Israell: and they smote them, and chased them vnto great Sidon, Ꟶ vnto the whott waters, and vnto the valeye of Mizpa which is Eastwarde: and smote them vntyll they had none remaynyng of them.
Josh.11.9	And Iosua dyd vnto them, as the Lorde bad hym: he houghed their horsses, and burnt their charettes with fyer.
Josh.11.10	And Iosua at that tyme turned backe, Ꟶ toke Hazor, Ꟶ smote the kyng therof with the swerde. And Hazor before tyme was the head of all those kingdomes.
Josh.11.11	And they smote all the soules that were therin with the edge of the swerde, vtterlye destroying all: Ꟶ nothing that breathed, was let remayne. And he burnt Hazor wt fyer.
Josh.11.12	And all the cyties of those kynges, and all the kynges of them, dyd Iosua take, and smote them wyth the edge of the swerde, and vtterlye destroyed them as Moses the seruaunt of the Lorde commaunded.
Josh.11.13	But Israell burnt none of the cyties that stode styll in their strength, saue Hazor onlye that Iosua burnt,
Josh.11.14	And all the spoyle of the sayde cyties and the catell, the children of Israel caught vnto them selues. But the men onlye they smote with the edge of the swerde vntill they had destroyed them nether left they ought that had breath.
Josh.11.15	As the Lorde commaunded Moses hys seruaunt, so dyd Moses commaunde Iosua, and euen so dyd Iosua so that he mynysshed no worde, of all that the Lorde commaunded Moses.
Josh.11.16	And so Iosua toke all the lande, the hylles and all the southe contreye, and all the lande of Gosan, and the lowe contrey, and the playne, and the mountayne of Israell, Ꟶ the lowe countrey of the same,
Josh.11.17	euen from the mounte of partyng, that gothe vp to Seir vnto the playne of Gad in the valeye of Libanon, vnder mounte Hermon. And all the kynges of the same he toke, Ꟶ smote them, and slewe them.
Josh.11.18	Iosua made warre longe tyme wt those kynges:
Josh.11.19	nether was there anye citie that made peace with the children of Israell, saue those Hethites that enhabited Gibeon, and therfore all other they toke wyth battell,

Josh.13.13	Neuerthelesse the chyldren of Israel expelled not the Gesurites Ꟶ the Machathites: But the Gesurites and the Machathites dwell amonge the Israelites euen vnto this daye,
Josh.13.14	Only vnto the trybe of Leui, he gaue none enheritaunce: But the offrynge of the Lorde God of Israel is theyr enheritaunce, as he sayde vnto them.
Josh.13.15	Moses gaue vnto the trybe of the chyldren of Ruben enheritaunce accordyng to theyr kynredes.

Josh.13.22	And Balaam also the sonne of Beor the sothesayer, dyd the children of Israel slaye with the swerde, among other of them that were slayne.
Josh.13.23	And the border of the chyldren of Ruben was Iordan with the contrey that lyeth theron. This was the enheritaunce of the chyldren of Ruben after their kynredes, cyties Ꟶ villages pertaynynge therto.
Josh.13.24	And Moses gaue enheritaunce vnto the trybe of Gad, euen vnto the chyldren of Gad he gaue by theyr kynredes.

Josh.13.32	These are the thinges which Moses did distribute in the feldes of Moab, on the other syde Iordan ouer against Iericho eastward.
Josh.13.33	But vnto the trybe of Leui, Moses gaue none enheritaunce, for the Lorde God of Israell is their enheritaunce, as he sayd vnto them.
Josh.14.1	And these are the contreyes which the chyldren of Israell enhereted in the lande of Canaan, which Eleazer the preaste, and Iosua the sonne of Nun and the auncient heades of the trybes of the chyldren of Israell, distributed to them.
Josh.14.2	By lotte they receaued their possessions as the Lorde commaunded by the hande of Moses, to geue vnto the nyne trybes, Ꟶ vnto the halfe trybe.
Josh.14.3	For Moses had geuen enheritaunce vnto two trybes and an halfe on the other syde Iordan. But vnto the Leuites he gaue none enheritaunce amonge them.
Josh.14.4	For the children of Ioseph were two tribes, Manasses Ꟶ Ephraim. And therfore they gaue no parte vnto the Leuites in the land, saue cyties to dwell in with the suburbes of the same, for their beastes and cattell.
Josh.14.5	As the Lorde commaunded Moses: euen so the children of Israel did when they deuided the lande.
Josh.14.6	And the children of Iuda came vnto Iosua in Gilgall. And Caleb the sonne of Iephune the kenesyte sayde vnto hym: thou wottest what the Lorde sayd vnto Moses the man of God, about my matter and thyne in Cades Barne.
Josh.14.7	Fourty yeare olde was I when Moses the seruaunt of the Lorde sent me from Cades Barne to spie out the lande. And I brought hym worde agayne euen as it was in myne herte.
Josh.14.8	Neuerthelesse my brethren that went vp wyth me, dyscouraged the herte of the people. And I folowed the Lorde God.
Josh.14.9	And Moses sware the same daye, saying: the lande wheron thy fete haue troaden, shalbe thyne enheritaunce and thy chyldrens for euer, because thou hast folowed the Lorde God.
Josh.14.10	And beholde, the Lorde hath kept me alyue (as he sayde) this fourtye and fyue yeares, euen sence the Lord spake this word vnto Moses, whyle the chyldren of Israell wanderyd in the wyldernesse. And now lo, I am this daye foure skore Ꟶ fyue yere old:
Josh.14.11	Ꟶ yet am as stronge at this tyme, as I was when Moses sent me: looke how stronge I was then, so strong am I now whether I go to warre, or come agayne.
Josh.14.12	Now therfore geue me thys mountayne wherof the Lorde spake in that daye, for thou herdest in that daye, how the Enakins are there, and the cities great Ꟶ walled. Peraduenture the Lorde wilbe with me, Ꟶ I shall he able to dryue them out, as the Lorde sayd.
Josh.14.13	And Iosua blessed him, Ꟶ gaue vnto Caleb the sonne of Iephune, Hebron to enheret.
Josh.14.14	And Hebron therfore became the enheritaunce of Caleb the sonne of Iephune the kenesite, vnto thys daye: because he folowed the Lord God of Israell.
Josh.14.15	And the name of Hebron was called in olde tyme, kariatharbe. For the same was a great man amonge the Enakims. And the lande ceased from warre.
Josh.15.1	This was the lotte of the trybe of the chyldren of Iuda by theyr kynredes: Namely, towarde the border of Edom in the wyldernesse of zin, southwarde, euen from the vtmoost parte of the southe coste.
Josh.15.2	And theyr south coste was from the brynke of the salt see, from a rock that leaneth southward.
Josh.15.3	And it went out to the south syde toward the goynge vp to Acrabim, Ꟶ went a longe to zinna, and ascended vp on the south syde vnto Cades Barne, Ꟶ went a longe to Hezron, and went vp to Adar, and fette a compase to Karca.
Josh.15.4	From thence went it a longe to Azmon, and reached vnto the ryuer of Egypt: and the ende of that cost was on the west syde. And this is theyr south coste.
Josh.15.5	Their east coste is the salt see, euen vnto the edge of Iordan.
Josh.15.6	And their border in the north quarter was from the rocke of the see and from the edge of Iordan. And the same border went vp to Bethhagla, and went a long by the northsyde of Betharabah, and vp from thence to the stone of Bohen the sonne of Ruben.
Josh.15.7	And agayne, thesame border went vp to Dabir from the valeye of Acor, and so northwarde, turnyng towarde Gilgall, that lieth before the goyng vp to Adonim, whych is of the southe syde of the ryuer. And the same border went vp to the waters of the fountayne of the Sonne, and ended at the well of Rogell.
Josh.15.8	And then went vp to the valeye of the sonne of Hennom, euen vnto the southe syde of Iebusi: the same is Ierusalem. And then went vp to the toppe of the hille that lyeth before the valeye of Hennon, westwarde, and by the edge of the valeye of the Giauntes northwarde:
Josh.15.9	And then it compaseth from the toppe of the hill vnto the fountayne of the water of Nephthoah, and gothe out at the cities of mount Ephron: and draweth to Baala, whiche is kiriathiarim,
Josh.15.10	and then it compaseth from Balah westwarde vnto mount Seir, Ꟶ then goeth a longe vnto the syde of mount Iarim, (which is Chesalon) on the north syde. And cometh downe to Bethsames, and gothe to Thamnah,
Josh.15.11	and gothe out agayne vnto the syde of Akaron northwarde: And then draweth to Secron and gothe a longe to mounte Balah, and goeth out at Iabnel: Ꟶ the endes of the coastes leaue at the west see.
Josh.15.12	And the west border was the gaeat see, and the same coaste was the coast of the chyldren of Iuda rounde about in theyr kynredes.
Josh.15.13	And vnto Caleb the sonne of Iephune dyd Iosua geue a parte among the children of Iuda, accordynge to the mouthe of the Lorde, euen kiriatharbe of the father of Enock, whiche cytye is Hebron.
Josh.15.14	And Caleb droue thence the thre sonnes of Enack, Sesai, and Ahman, and Thalmai, which were, the sonnes of Enack.
Josh.15.15	And he went vp thence, to the enhabitoures of Dabir. And the name of Dabir in the olde tyme was kariath sephar.
Josh.15.16	And Caleb sayde: he that smyteth kariath sepher, Ꟶ taketh it: to hym wyll I geue Acsah my daughter to wyfe.
Josh.15.17	And Othniel, the sonne of kenes, the brother of Caleb toke it. And he gaue hym Acsah hys daughter to wyfe.
Josh.15.18	And as she went in vnto hym, she moued hym, to aske of her father a felde. And she alyghted of her asse. And Caleb sayde vnto her, what ayleth the?
Josh.15.19	Who answered: gyue me a blessyng: for thou hast geuen me a south lande: geue me also springes of water. And he gaue her sprynges of water, bothe aboue and benethe.
Josh.15.20	Thys is the enheritaunce of the trybe of the children of Iuda by their kynredes.

Josh.16.8	And their border went from Thaphuah westwarde vnto the ryuer kanah, and the endes were the west see. This is the enheritaunce of the trybe of the children of Ephraim by their kynredes.
Josh.16.9	And the separate cyties for the children of Ephraim, were amonge the enheritaunce of the children of Manasses: euen the cyties with their villages.
Josh.16.10	And they draue not out the Cananites y dwelte in Gasor: but the Cananites dwell amonge the Ephraites vnto this daye, and serue vnder tribute.
Josh.17.1	This was the lotte of the tribe of Manasses, which was the Eldest sonne of Ioseph. And Machir the Eldest sonne of Manasses which was the father of Gilead (and a man of warre) had Gilead and Basan,
Josh.17.2	This was the possession of the rest of the children of Manasses by their kinredes: Namely, of the children of Abiezer: the children of Helek: the children of Ariel: the children of Sichem, the children of Hepher: the children of Semida: for these were the male children of Manasses the sonne of Ioseph by their kinredes.
Josh.17.3	But zelaphead the sonne of Hepher, the sonne of Gilead, the sonne of Machir, the sonne of Manasses, had no sonnes but daughters whose names are these: Mahela, Noa, Hagla, Melcha Ꟶ Thirza:
Josh.17.4	which came before Eleazar the preaste, Ꟶ before Iosua the sonne of Nun, Ꟶ before the Lordes saying: the Lorde commaunded Moses to geue vs an enheritaunce amonge oure brethren. And therfore according to the commaundement of the Lord, he gaue them an enherytaunce amonge the brethren of their father.
Josh.17.5	And there felle ten porcyons to Manasses, besyde the lande of Gilead Ꟶ Basan, which is on the other syde Iordan:
Josh.17.6	because the daughters of Manasses dyd enherett amonge hys sonnes. And Manasses other sonnes, had the lande of Gilead.
Josh.17.7	And the cooste of Manasses was from Aser to Machmathah that lieth before Sichem and went a longe on the ryght hande, euen vnto the enhabiters of Entaphuah,
Josh.17.8	Ꟶ the land of Thaphuah belonged to Manasses, whych Thaphuah is besyde the border of Manasses, and besyde the border of the children of Ephraim.
Josh.17.9	And the cooste descended vnto the ryuer Canah southwarde, euen to the ryuer of the cyties of Ephraim, and betwene the cyties of Manasses. The cooste of Manasses wente also on the northsyde to the ryuer, Ꟶ the endes of it go out at the see:
Josh.17.10	so that the south pertayned to Ephraim, Ꟶ the northe to Manasses, and the see is hys border. And they mette togeather in Aser northwarde, and in Isacar eastwarde.
Josh.17.11	And Manasses had in Isacar Ꟶ in Aser, Bethsean, Ꟶ her townes: Iiblean, and hir townes: Ꟶ the enhabitoures of Dor, wyth the townes: pertaynyng to the same: Ꟶ the enhabitoures of Endor with the townes of the same: and the enhabitoures of Thaanath with her townes: and the enhabitoures of Magedo with the townes of the same, euen thre contreys.
Josh.17.12	Yet the children of Manasses coulde not ouercome those cyties. But the Cananites presumed to dwell in the same land,
Josh.17.13	Neuerthelesse, assone as the children of Israel were waxed strong, they put the Cananites vnder tribute, but expelled them not.
Josh.17.14	And the chyldren of Ioseph spake vnto Iosua saying: why hast thou geuen me but one lotte and one porcyon to enheret, seing I am a great people, Ꟶ for as moche as the Lorde hath blessed me hitherto?
Josh.17.15	and Iosua answered them: yf thou be moche people, then gett the vp to the wodde contreye, and prepare for thy selffe there in the lande of the Pheresites Ꟶ of the Giauntes, yf mounte Ephraim be to narowe for the.
Josh.17.16	And the children of Ioseph sayd: The hill is not ynough for vs: Ꟶ all the Cananites that dwel in the lowe contreye haue charettes of yron, Ꟶ so haue they that enhabite Bethsean, and the townes of the same, Ꟶ they also dwel in the valeye of Iezreel.
Josh.17.17	And Iosua sayde vnto the house of Ioseph, Ephraim Ꟶ Manasses: ye be moche people, and haue great power, Ꟶ shall not therfore haue one lotte.
Josh.17.18	Therfore the hill shalbe youres, Ꟶ ye shall cut downe the wodd that is in it: Ꟶ the endes of it shalbe youres, yf ye cast out the Cananites which haue yron charettes, Ꟶ are very stronge.
Josh.18.1	And the whole congregacion of the children of Israel came together at Silo, and set vp the tabernacle of witnesse there, and the lande was in subieccion before them.
Josh.18.2	And there remayned amonge the children of Israel seuen tribes, whych had not yet receaued their enheritaunce.

Josh.22.17	Is the wicked deade of Peor to lyttell for vs, wherof we are not yet cleansed vnto thys daye, and for the which there was in the congregacion of the people a plage of the Lord?
Josh.22.18	Ye also are turned awaye thys daye from the Lorde. And seynge ye rebelle to daye agaynst the Lorde, it wil come to passe, that tomorow he shall be wroth wt all the congregacion of Israel.

Josh.22.22	The God of goddes, the Lorde, God of goddes, euen the Lord he knoweth, Ꟶ Israel also shall knowe. If it be to rebelle, or to transgresse agaynst the Lorde, then thou Lorde saue vs not thys daye.

Josh.22.24	And yf we haue not rather done it of a carefulnes Ꟶ of a sure occasion, sayenge: In tyme to come your children might saye vnto oures: what haue ye to do with the Lorde God of Israel?
Josh.22.25	the Lorde hath made Iordan a border betwene vs and you (ye children of Ruben and of Gad) ye haue no parte therfore in the Lorde: and so shall youre children make oure children ceasse from fearinge the Lorde.
Josh.22.26	Therfore we sayd: We wil make vs an aulter, not for burntofferinge, nor for sacrifice,
Josh.22.27	but for a witnesse betwene vs and you, and oure generacyons after vs, that we shulde serue the Lorde, with oure offeringes, sacrifices and peace offeringes before him: and that youre children shulde not saye to oures in time to come: ye haue no parte in the Lorde.
Josh.22.28	Therfore sayde we, that if they shulde so saye to vs or to oure generacions in tyme to come, that we wolde saye agayne: Beholde the fassion of the aulter of the Lorde, which oure fathers made, nether for burntofferynges nor sacrifices, but for a witnesse betwene vs and you.
Josh.22.29	God forbyd, that we shuld rebell agaynst the Lorde, and turne thys daye from after him, Ꟶ buyld any other aulter for burntofferinges, oblacions, or sacrifices, saue the altare of the Lord oure God, that is before his tabernacle.
Josh.22.30	And when Phinehes the Preaste, and the Lordes of the congregacion and heades ouer the thousandes of Israell which were with him, hearde these wordes that the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad and the children of Manasses spake, they were well content.
Josh.22.31	And Phinehes the sonne of Eleazar the preaste sayde vnto the children of Ruben, and to the children of Gad, Ꟶ to the children of Manasses: this daye we perceaue, that the Lord is among vs, because ye haue not done this trespase agaynst the Lorde: Now ye haue rydde the children of Israell out of the hande of the Lorde.
Josh.22.32	And Phinehes the sonne of Eleazar the Preaste wt the Lordes, retourned from the children of Ruben, and from the children of Gad out of the lande of Gilead vnto the lande of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them this worde agayne.
Josh.22.33	And the sayeng pleased the children of Israel, and they blessed God, and dyd not entende to go agaynst them in batell, Ꟶ to destroye the lande which the children of Ruben and Gad dwelt in.
Josh.22.34	And the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad called the aulter: Oure witnesse, that the Lorde is God.
Josh.23.1	And it came to passe a longe ceason after that the Lorde had geuen reste vnto Israel from all theyr enemyes rounde about, that Iosua waxed olde, and was stricken in age.
Josh.23.2	And Iosua called for all Israel, and for their elders, their heades their Iudges and officers, and sayde vnto them: I am olde and stryken in age.
Josh.23.3	And ye haue sene all that the Lorde youre God hath done vnto all these nacions befo you, how the Lorde youre God hath fought for you.
Josh.23.4	Beholde, I haue subdued vnto you these nacions that remayne, to be an enheritaunce for youre tribes: euen from Iordan, and (from the lande) of all the nacions that I haue destroyed, euen vnto the great See westwarde.
Josh.23.5	And the Lorde youre God shall expell them before you, and cast them from out of youre sight, and ye shall conquere their lande, as the Lorde youre God hath saide vnto you.
Josh.23.6	Go to therfore as strongly as ye maye, that ye take hede and do all that is written in the boke of the lawe of Moses, that ye vowe not a syde therfrom, to the ryght hand or to the lefte:
Josh.23.7	and lest that whan ye come amonge these nacions, (euen amonge these that are left with you) ye make mencion or sweare by the names of their goddes: and that ye nether serue them, nor bowe youre selues vnto them.
Josh.23.8	But that ye sticke fast vnto the Lorde youre God, as ye haue done vnto this daye.
Josh.23.9	So shall the Lorde cast out before you great nacions and myghtye, as no man hath bene able to stande before you hitherto.
Josh.23.10	One man of you shall chase a thousande: for the Lorde youre God he fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.
Josh.23.11	Take good hede therfore vnto youre selues, that ye loue the Lorde youre God.
Josh.23.12	Els, yf ye go backe and cleaue vnto the rest of these nacions that remayne wyth you, and shall make mariages with them, Ꟶ go in vnto them, and they to you:
Josh.23.13	be ye sure, that the Lorde youre God will nomore cast out all these nacions from before you. But they shalbe snares and trappes vnto you and scourges in youre sydes, and thornes in youre eyes, vntyll ye peryshe from of thys good lande, whych the Lorde youre God hath geuen you.
Josh.23.14	And behold, this daye, do I entre in to the waye of all the worlde, Ꟶ ye knowe in all your hertes Ꟶ in all youre soules, that nothyng hath fayled of all the good thynges which the Lord youre God promysed you:
Josh.23.15	But all are come to passe, Ꟶ nothyng hath fayled therof. Therfore, as all good thinges are come vpon you, which the Lorde youre God promysed you, so shall the Lorde bryng vpon you all euell, vntyll he haue destroyed you from of thys good lande, whych the Lorde youre God hath geuen you,
Josh.23.16	when ye haue transgressed the appointment of the Lorde youre God, which he commaunded you: and haue gone and serued straunge goddes, and bowed youre selues to them. Then shall the wrath of the Lorde waxe whote vpon you, Ꟶ ye shall peryshe quicklye from of the good lande, which he hath geuen you,
Josh.24.1	And Iosua geathered all the trybes of Israell to Sichem, and called for the elders of Israell, and for theyr heades, Iudges and officers, and they presented them selues before God.
Josh.24.2	And Iosua sayde vnto all the people: thus sayth the Lord God of Israell: youre fathers dwelt on the other syde of the floud in olde tyme: euen Thareh the father of Abraham Ꟶ of Nachor, and serued straunge goddes.
Josh.24.3	And I toke youre father Abraham from the other syde of the floude, Ꟶ brought him thorow out all the lande of Canaan, Ꟶ multiplied his seed, and gaue him Isahac.
Josh.24.4	And I gaue vnto Isahac, Iacob Ꟶ Esau. And I gaue vnto Esau mount Seir, to possesse it. But Iacob and his children went downe into Egypte.
Josh.24.5	I sent Moses also Ꟶ Aaron. And I plaged Egypte: Ꟶ whan I had so done among them,
Josh.24.6	I brought you out, and I brought youre fathers out of Egypte. And as they came vnto the see, the Egypcians folowed after youre fathers with charettes Ꟶ horsmen, vnto the redd see.
Josh.24.7	And whan they cried vnto the Lord, the Lord put darcknesse betwene you and the Egypcians, and brought the see vpon them, and couered them. And youre eyes haue sene what I haue done to the Egypcians. And ye dwelt in the wildernesse a longe ceason.
Josh.24.8	And I brought you into the lande of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other syde Iordan. And they fought with you: and I gaue them into your hand, that ye myght conquere their contre. And I destroyed them from out of youre syght.
Josh.24.9	Then Balak the sonne of ziphor, king of Moab arose, Ꟶ warred agaynst Israell, Ꟶ sent Ꟶ called Balaam the sonne of Beor for to cursse you.
Josh.24.10	But I wolde not herken vnto Balaam, Ꟶ therfore he rather blessed you: And so I deliuered you out of his hande.
Josh.24.11	And ye went ouer Iordan, and came vnto Iericho, and the men of Iericho fought agaynst you: the Amorites, Pheresites, Canaanites, Hethites, Girgosites, Heuites, Ꟶ Iebusites, and I deliuered them in to youre hande.
Josh.24.12	And I sent hornettes before you, whych cast them out of youre sight: euen the two kinges of the Amorites: but not with your owne swerde, or with youre owne bowe.
Josh.24.13	And I haue geuen you a lande, in which ye dyd no laboure, and cyties which you bilt not, and which ye dwell in: vineyardes also, and Olyue trees which ye planted not, and whereof ye do eate.
Josh.24.14	Now therfore feare the Lorde, Ꟶ serue him in perfectnesse and truthe: And put awaye the goddes, whych youre fathers serued on the other syde of the floude, and in Egypte, and serue ye the Lorde.
Josh.24.15	And yf it seme euell vnto you to serue the Lorde, then chose you this daye whom you will serue: whether the goddes which youre fathers serued (that were on the other syde of the floude) ether the Goddes of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell. As for me and my howse, we will serue the Lorde.
Josh.24.16	The people answered and sayde: God forbyd, that we shulde forsake the Lorde, and serue straunge goddes.
Josh.24.17	For the Lorde oure God, he it is that brought vs and oure fathers out of the lande of Egypte, and from the howse of bondage, and which dyd those great miracles in oure syght, Ꟶ preserued vs in all the waye that we went, Ꟶ amonge all the nacions which we came thorow.
Josh.24.18	And the Lorde dyd cast out before vs all the nacions, specially the Amorites, which dwelt in the lande. And therfore will we also serue the Lorde, for he is oure God.
Josh.24.19	And Iosua sayd vnto the people, Ye can not serue the Lorde: for he is an holye God, and a gelous God, and cannot beare youre iniquite and synne.
Josh.24.20	Yf ye forsake the Lorde and serue straunge goddes, he will turne and do you euell, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
Josh.24.21	And the people sayde vnto Iosua: naye, but we will serue the Lorde.
Josh.24.22	And Iosua sayde vnto the people: ye are witnesses youre selues, that ye haue chosen you the Lorde, to serue him: and they sayd: we are wytnesses.
Josh.24.23	Then put awaye (sayde he) the straunge goddes which are amonge you, and bowe youre hertes vnto the Lorde God of Israell.
Josh.24.24	The people sayde vnto Iosua: the Lord oure God will we serue, and his voyce will we obeye,
Josh.24.25	And so Iosua made a couenant with the people the same daye, and set an ordinaunce and lawe before them in Sichem.
Josh.24.26	And Iosua wrote these wordes in the boke of the lawe of God, and toke a great stone, and pitched it on ende in the sayde place, euen vnder an oke that was in the sanctuarye of the Lorde.
Josh.24.27	And Iosua sayde vnto all the people: beholde, this stone shalbe a witnesse vnto vs, for it hath hearde all the wordes of the Lorde which he spake wyth vs, It shalbe therfore a witnesse vnto you, lest ye denye youre God.
Josh.24.28	And so Iosua let the people departe, euery man vnto his enheritaunce.
Josh.24.29	And after these thinges it came to passe, that Iosua the sonne of Nun, the seruaunt of the Lorde died, beyng an hundreth and ten yeres olde.
Josh.24.30	And they buryed hym in the contrey of hys enheritaunce, euen in Thamnath Sareth, which is in mount Ephraim, on the northsyde of the hill of Gaas.
Josh.24.31	And Israel serued the Lord all the dayes of Iosua, Ꟶ all the dayes of the elders that ouer lyued Iosua, and whych had knowne all the worckes of the Lorde that he had done for Israel.
Josh.24.32	And the bones of Ioseph, which the children of Israell brought out of Egypte, buryed they in Sichem in a parcell of grounde, whych Iacob bought of the sonnes of Hemor the father of Sichem, for an hundreth peaces of syluer, and it became the enheritaunce of the children of Ioseph.
Josh.24.33	And Eleazar the sonne of Aaron dyed, whom they buryed in a hill that pertayned to Phinehes his sonne, which (hill) was geuen him in mount Ephraim.
Josh.0.0	¶ The ende of the boke of Iosua, whom the Hebrues call Iehosua.
