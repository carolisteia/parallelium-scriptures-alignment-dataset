Dan.0.0	¶ The booke of the prophete Daniel
Dan.1.1	In the thyrde yeare of the rayne of Iehoakim king of Iuda, came Nabuchodonosor kynge of Babilon vnto Ierusalem, Ꟶ beseged it:
Dan.1.2	and the Lorde delyuered Iehoakim the kynge of Iuda into hys hande, with certayne ornamentes of the house of God, which he caryed awaye vnto the lande of Sennar, to the house of his God, and there he brought them into hys goddes treasury.
Dan.1.3	And the kynge spake vnto Asphanaz the chefe chamberlayne, that he shulde brynge hym certayne of the chyldren of Israel, that were come of the kynges sede and of prynces,
Dan.1.4	yonge spryngaldes without eny blemysh, but fayre and welfauored, instruct in all wysedome, comynge and vnderstandynge: which were able to stande in the kinges palace, to reade and to learne for to speake Chaldeysh.
Dan.1.5	Unto these the kynge appoynted a certayne porcion of his awne meate, and of the wyne, which he drancke hym selfe, so to norysh them thre yeare: that afterwarde they myght stande before the kynge.
Dan.1.6	Amonge these nowe were certayne of the chyldren of Iuda: namely Daniel, Ananias, Misael and Azarias.
Dan.1.7	Unto these, the chefe chamberlayne gaue other names, and called Daniel, Balthasar: Ananias, Sidrach, Misael, Misach: and Asarias, Abednago.
Dan.1.8	But Daniel was at a poynt with hym selfe, that he wolde not be defyled thorowe the kynges meate, ner the wyne which he droncke. And this he desyred of the chefe chamberlayn, lest he shuld defyle hym selfe.
Dan.1.9	So God gaue Daniel fauoure and grace before the chefe chamberlay
Dan.1.10	that he sayde vnto him: I am afrayde of my Lorde the kyng, which hath appoynted you your meate and drincke: lest he spye your faces to be worse lykyng then the other springaldes of your age, and so ye shall make me lose my head vnto the kynge.
Dan.1.11	Then Daniel answered Melassar, whom the chefe chamberlayne had set ouer Daniel, Ananias, Misael and Asarias, and sayd:
Dan.1.12	O proue but ten dayes with thy seruauntes, and let vs haue potage to eate, Ꟶ water to drincke:
Dan.1.13	then loke vpon oure faces, Ꟶ theyrs that eate of the kinges meate. And as thou seyst, so deale with thy seruauntes.
Dan.1.14	So he consented to them in thys matter, Ꟶ proued them .x. dayes.
Dan.1.15	And after the ten dayes, theyr faces were better lykinge and fatter, then all the yonge springaldes, which dyd eate of the kynges meate.
Dan.1.16	Thus Melassar toke awaye their meate and wyne, and gaue them potage therfore.
Dan.1.17	God gaue nowe these foure springaldes connynge and lernyng in all scripture and wysdome: but vnto Daniel specially, he gaue vnderstandynge of all visyons and dreames.
Dan.1.18	Nowe when the tyme was expyred, that the kynge had appoynted to bryng in these yong spryngaldes vnto hym: the chefe chamberlayne brought them before Nabuchodonosor,
Dan.1.19	and the kinge communed with them. But among them all were founde none soche as Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Asarias. Therfore stode they before the kinge
Dan.1.20	which in all wysdome and matters of vnderstandinge, that he enquered of them, founde them ten tymes better, then all the sothsayers and charmers, that were in all his realme.
Dan.1.21	And Daniel abode styll, vnto the fyrst yeare of kynge Cyrus.
Dan.2.1	In the seconde yeare of the raygne of Nabuchodonosor, had Nabuchodonosor a dreame, where thorow his sprete was vexed, and his slepe brake from hym.
Dan.2.2	Then the kynge commaunded to call to gether all the sothsayers, charmers, witches and caldees, for to shewe the kynge hys dreame. So they came, and stode before the kynge.
Dan.2.3	And the kynge sayde vnto them: I haue dreamed a dreame, and my sprete was so troubled therwith, that I haue clene forgotten, what I dreamed.
Dan.2.4	Upon this the Caldees answered the kynge in the Syrians speache: O kynge, God saue thy lyfe for euer. Shewe thy seruauntes the dreame, and we shal shewe the, what it meaneth.
Dan.2.5	The kynge gaue the Caldees theyr answere and sayde: It is gone fro me. Yf ye wyll not make me vnderstande the dreame with the interpretacyon therof, ye shall dye, and youre houses shalbe prysed.
Dan.2.6	But yf yee tell me the dreame and the meanynge therof, ye shall haue of me gyftes, rewardes and greate honoure: onely, shewe me the dreame and the signifycacyon of it.
Dan.2.7	They answered agayne, and sayde: the kynge must shewe his seruauntes the dreame, and so shall we declare what it meaneth.
Dan.2.8	Then the kynge answered, saying: I perceaue of a trueth, that ye do but prolonge the tyme: for so moche as ye se, that the thynge is gone fro me.
Dan.2.9	Therfore ye wyll not tell me the dreame, ye shall all haue one iudgement. But ye fayne Ꟶ dissemble wt vayne wordes, which ye speake before me, to put of the tyme. Therfore tell me the dreame, Ꟶ so shall I knowe, yf ye can shewe me, what it meaneth.
Dan.2.10	Upon this, the Caldees gaue answere before the kynge, and sayde: there is no man vpon earth, that can tell the thinge, which the kynge speaketh of: yee, there is nether kynge, prince ner Lorde, that euer asked soche thynges at a sothsayer, charmer or Caldeer:
Dan.2.11	for it is a very harde matter, that the kynge requyreth. Nether is there any, that can certifye the kynge therof, excepte the goddes: whose dwellynge is not amonge the creatures.
Dan.2.12	For the which cause the kynge was wroth with greate indignacion, and commaunded to destroye all the wyse men at Babylon:
Dan.2.13	Ꟶ the proclamacyon wente forth, and the wyse men were slayne. They sought also to slaye Daniel with his companyons.
Dan.2.14	Then Daniel enquered of Arioch the kinges stewarde, of the iudgement and sentence, that was gone forth alredy to kyll soch as were wyse at Babylon.
Dan.2.15	He answered and sayde vnto Arioch beynge then the kynges debyte. Why hath the kynge proclamed so cruell a sentence? So Arioch tolde Daniel the matter.
Dan.2.16	Upon this, wente Daniel vp, and desyred the kynge, that he myght haue leysoure, to shewe the kynge the interpretacyon,
Dan.2.17	Ꟶ then came he home agayne Ꟶ shewed the thynge vnto. Ananias, Misael Ꟶ Asarias his companions:
Dan.2.18	that they shulde beseche the God of heauen for grace in thys secret, that Daniel Ꟶ hys felowes with other soche as were wyse in Babylon, perished not.
Dan.2.19	Then was the mystery shewed vnto Daniel in a visyon by nyght. And Daniel praysed the God of heauen.
Dan.2.20	Daniel also cried loude, Ꟶ sayde: O that the name of God myght be praysed for euer and euer, for wysdome and strength are hys awne:
Dan.2.21	he chaungeth the tymes and ages he putteth downe kynges, he setteth vp kynges: he geueth wysdome vnto the wyse, Ꟶ vnderstandinge to those that vnderstande,
Dan.2.22	he openeth the depe secretes: he knoweth the thinge that lyeth in darcknesse for the lyght dwelleth with hym.
Dan.2.23	I thancke the, Ꟶ prayse the (O thou God of my fathers) that thou hast lent me wysdome Ꟶ strength, Ꟶ hast shewed me the thynge, that we desyred of the, for thou hast opened the kynges matter vnto me.
Dan.2.24	Upon this went Daniel in vnto Arioch, whom the kynge had ordened to destroye the wyse at Babylon he went vnto him, Ꟶ sayde: destroye not soche as are wyse in Babylon, but brynge me in vnto the kyng, and I shall shewe the kynge the interpretacyon.
Dan.2.25	Then Arioch brought Daniel into the kynge in all the haste, and sayde vnto hym: I haue founde a man amonge the presoners of Iuda, that shall shewe the kynge the interpretacyon.
Dan.2.26	Then answered the kynge, Ꟶ sayde vnto Daniel, whose name was Balthazar. Art thou he that canst shewe me the dreame, whiche I haue sene, Ꟶ the interpretacyon therof?
Dan.2.27	Daniel answered the kynge to his face, Ꟶ sayde: As for thys secrete, for the which the kynge maketh inquisicyon: it is nether the wyse, the sorcerer, the charmer ner the deuell coniurer, that can certifye the kynge of it.
Dan.2.28	Only God in heauen can open secretes, and he it is, that sheweth the kynge Nabuchodonosor, what is for to come in the latter dayes. Thy dreame, Ꟶ that which thou hast sene in thyne head vpon thy bed, is this:
Dan.2.29	O kynge thou dydest cast in thy mynde, what shulde come herafter. So he that is the opener of mysteries, telleth the, what is for to come.
Dan.2.30	As for me, this secrete is not shewed me, for eny wysdome that I haue, more then eny other lyuinge: but onely that I myght shewe the kynge the interpretacyon, and that he myght knowe the thoughtes of his awne herte.
Dan.2.31	Thou kynge sawest, and beholde: there stode before the a greate Image, whose fygure was maruelous greate, and hys visage grymme.
Dan.2.32	The Image heade was of fyne golde, hys brest Ꟶ armes of siluer, his body and loynes were of copper,
Dan.2.33	his legges were of yron, hys fete were parte of yron, and parte of earth.
Dan.2.34	This thou sawest tyll, the tyme that, without eny handes, there was hewen of, a stone which smote the Image vpon the fete, that were both of yron and earth, and brake them to poulder:
Dan.2.35	then was the yron, the earth, the copper, the syluer and golde broken altogether in peces: and became lyke the chaffe of corne, that the wynde bloweth awaye from the somer floores, that they can no more be founde. But the stone that smote the ymage, became a greate mountayne, which fulfylleth the whole earth:
Dan.2.36	This is the dreame. And nowe wyll we shewe before the kyng, what it meaneth.
Dan.2.37	O kynge, thou art a kynge of kynges: For the God of heauen hath geuen the a kyngdome, ryches, strength and maiesty:
Dan.2.38	Ꟶ hath delyuered the all thynges, that are amonge the children of men: the beastes of the felde, Ꟶ the foules vnder the heauen, and geuen the dominion ouer them all. Thou art that golden head.
Dan.2.39	After that there shall aryse another kingdome, which shall be lesse then thyne. The thyrde kyngdome shalbe lyke copper, Ꟶ haue dominacyon in all landes.
Dan.2.40	The fourth kyngdome shall be as stronge as yron. For lyke as yron broseth and breaketh all thynges: Yee, euen as yron beateth euery thynge downe, so shall it beate downe and destroye.
Dan.2.41	Where as thou sawest the fete and toes, parte of earth and parte of yron: that is a deuyded kyngdome, whyche neuertheles shall haue some of the yron grounde mixte with it for so moche as thou hast sene the yron mixte with the claye.
Dan.2.42	The toes of the fete that were parte of yron and parte of claye, sygnifyeth: that it shalbe a kyngdome partely stronge and partely weake.
Dan.2.43	And where as thou sawest yron myxte wyth claye: they shall myngle them selues wyth the sede of symple people, Ꟶ yet not contynue one wyth another, lyke as yron wyll not be souldered wyth a potsherde.
Dan.2.44	In the dayes of these kynges, shall the God of heauen set vp an euerlasting kyngdome whych shall not perish, Ꟶ his kyngdome shal not be geuen ouer to another people: yee, the same shall breake Ꟶ destroye all these kyngdomes, but it shall endure for euer.
Dan.2.45	And where as thou sawest, that wythout eny handes there was cut out of the mounte a stone, which brake the yron, the copper, the earth, the syluer and golde in peces: by that hath the greate God shewed the kyng, what wyll come after this. This is a true dreame, and the interpretacyon of it is sure.
Dan.2.46	Then the kynge Nabuchodonosor fell downe vpon his face, Ꟶ bowed him selfe vnto Daniel, and commaunded that they shuld offre meatofferinges and swete odoures vnto hym.
Dan.2.47	The kynge answered Daniel, and sayde: yee, of a trueth youre God is a God aboue all goddes, a Lorde aboue all kynges, and an opener of secretes: seynge thou canst discouer this mysterie.
Dan.2.48	So the kynge made Daniel a greate man, and gaue hym many Ꟶ greate gyftes. He made him ruler of all the countrees of Babylon, and Lord of all the nobles, that were at Babylon.
Dan.2.49	Nowe Daniel intreated the kynge for Sidrach, Misach and Abednago, so that he made them rulers ouer all the officers in the lande of Babylon: But Daniel hym selfe remayned styll in the courte by the kynge.
Dan.3.1	Nabuchodonosor the kynge caused a golden Image to be made, whych was .lx. cubytes hye, and syxe cubytes thycke. This he made to be set vp in the felde of Dura in the land of Babylo
Dan.3.2	Ꟶ sent oute to gather together the dukes, Lordes and nobles, the iudges and officers, the debytes and shreues: with all the rulers of the lande: that they myght come to the dedicacyon of the Image which Nabuchodonosor the kynge had set vp.
Dan.3.3	So the dukes, Lordes and nobles, the iudges and offycers, debytes and shreues with all the rulers of the lande gathered them together, and came vnto the dedycatynge of the Image, that Nabuchodonosor the kynge had set vp. Nowe when they stode before the Image, which Nabuchodonosor set vp,
Dan.3.4	the bedel cried out with all his might: O ye people, kynreddes and tunges, to you be it sayde:
Dan.3.5	that when ye heare the noyse of the trompettes, which shalbe blowen, with the harpes, shawmes, Psalteries, Symphonies and all maner of Musick: ye fall downe and worshippe the golden Image, that Nabuchodonosor the kynge hath set vp.
Dan.3.6	Whoso then falleth not downe Ꟶ boweth him selfe, shall euen the same houre be cast into an hote burnynge ouen.
Dan.3.7	Therfore, when all the folcke herde the noyse of the trompettes that were blowen, with the harpes, shawmes, Psalteries, Symphonies and all kynde of Melody, then all the people, kynreddes and nacyons fell downe, and bowed them selues vnto the golden Image, that Nabuchodonosor the kynge had set vp.
Dan.3.8	Now were there certayne men of the Caldees, that wente euen then and accused the Iewes,
Dan.3.9	and sayde vnto the kynge Nabuchodonosor: O kyng, God saue thy lyfe for euer,
Dan.3.10	Thou beynge kynge hast geuen a commaundement, that all men when they heare the noyse of the trompettes, harpes, shawmes, psalteries, symphonies and all the other melodies: shall fall downe and bowe them selues towarde the golden Image:
Dan.3.11	whoso then fell not downe Ꟶ worshypped not that, he shulde be cast into an hote burnynge ouen.
Dan.3.12	Nowe are there certayne Iewes, whom thou hast set ouer the offyces of the lande of Babylon: namely, Sydrach: Mysach and Abednago. These men (O kyng) regarde not thy commaundment, yee, they wyll not serue thy goddes, ner bowe them selues to the golden Image, that thou hast set vp.
Dan.3.13	Then Nabuchodonosor in a cruell wrath and displeasure, commaunded, that Sidrach Misach and Abednago shulde be brought vnto hym. So these men were brought before the kynge.
Dan.3.14	Then Nabuchodonosor spake vnto them, Ꟶ sayde: what? O Sidrach Misach and Abednago, wyll not ye serue my goddes? nor bowe youre selues to the golden Image, that I haue set vp.
Dan.3.15	Well, be redy herafter, when ye heare the noyse of the trompettes blowe with the harpes, shawmes, psalteries, symphonyes and all the other melodyes: that ye fall downe, and worshyppe the Image which I haue made. But yf ye worshyppe it not, ye shall be cast immediatly into an hote burnyng ouen. Let se, what God is there, that maye delyuer you oute of my handes?
Dan.3.16	Sydrach, Misach and Abednago answered the kynge, Ꟶ sayde: O Nabuchodonosor, we ought not to consente vnto the in this matter, for why?
Dan.3.17	oure God whom we serue, is able to kepe vs from the hote burnyng ouen (O kynge) and can ryght well delyuer vs out of thy handes.
Dan.3.18	And though he wyll not, yet shalt thou knowe (O kyng) that we will not serue thy goddes, ner do reuerence to the Image, which thou hast set vp.
Dan.3.19	Then was Nabuchodonosor full of indignacyon, so that the countenaunce of his face chaunged vpon Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago. Therfore he charged and commaunded, that the ouen shuld be made seuen tymes hotter, then it was wonte to be:
Dan.3.20	Ꟶ spake vnto the strongest worthies that were in his hoste, for to bynde Sidrach, Misach and Abednago, and to cast them into the hote burnynge ouen.
Dan.3.21	So these men were bounde in their cotes hosen, shues wyth their other garmentes, Ꟶ cast into the hote burnynge ouen:
Dan.3.22	for the kynges commaundement was so strayte, and the ouen was excedynge hote. As for the men that put in Sidrach, Misach Ꟶ Abednago, the flamme of the fyre destroyed them.
Dan.3.23	And these thre men Sidrach, Misach Ꟶ Abednago fell downe in the hote burnynge ouen, beynge faste bounde.
Dan.3.24	Then Nabuchodonosor the kyng marueled and stode vp in all hast: he spake vnto hys councell and sayde: dyd not ye cast these thre men bounde into the fyre? They answered, and sayde vnto the king: Yee, O kynge.
Dan.3.25	He answered, and sayde: lo, for all that, yet do I se foure men going lowse in the myddest of the fyer, and nothynge corrupte: and the fourth is lyke the sonne of God to loke vpon.
Dan.3.26	Upon thys went Nabuchodonosor vnto the mouth of the hote burning ouen: he spake also, and sayde: O Sidrach, Misach and Abednago, ye seruauntes of the hye God, go forth, Ꟶ come hyther. And so Sidrach, Misach Ꟶ Abednago went out of the fier.
Dan.3.27	Then the dukes, lordes Ꟶ nobles, Ꟶ the kinges councell came together to se these men, vpon whom the fyer had no maner of power in theyr bodies. In somoch that the very here of their heed was not burnt, Ꟶ theyr clothes vnchaunged: yee, there was no smell of fier felt vpon them.
Dan.3.28	Then spake Nabuchodonosor, and sayde, Blessed be the God of Sidrach, Misach and Abednago: which hath sent his angell, and defended his seruauntes, that put theyr trust in him: that haue altered the kinges commaundement: and ieoperde their bodies ther vpon: rather then they wolde serue or worshippe eny other God, excepte their awne God onely.
Dan.3.29	Therfore I wyll and commaunde, that all people, kynredes and tunges, which speake any blasphemy agaynst the God of Sydrach, Misach, and Abednago, shall dye, and their houses shalbe prysed: Because, there is no God that maye saue, as thys.
Dan.3.30	So the kynge promoted Sidrach, Misach, Ꟶ Abdenego, in the lande of Babylon.
Dan.4.1	Nabuchodonosor kynge vnto all people, kynreddes and tunges that dwell vpon the whole earth: peace be multiplied among you.
Dan.4.2	I thought it good to shewe the tokens and maruelous worckes, that the hye God hath wrought vpon me.
Dan.4.3	O, howe great are his tokens, and howe myghtie are his wonders? His kyngdome is an euerlasting kyngdome, and his power lasteth for euer and euer.
Dan.4.4	I Nabuchodonosor beyng at rest in myne house and florishynge in my palace,
Dan.4.5	sawe a dreame, which made me afrayed: Ꟶ the thoughtes that I had vpon my bedd, with the visyons of myne head, troubled me.
Dan.4.6	Then sent I out a commission, that all they which were of wysdome at Babilon shulde be brought before me, to tell me the interpretacyon of the dreame.
Dan.4.7	So there came the sothsayers, charmers, Caldees and coniurers of deuels: to whom I tolde the dreame, but what it betokened, they coulde not shewe me:
Dan.4.8	tyll at the last, there came one Daniel (other wyse called Balthazar, according to the name of my God) which hath the sprete of the holy goddes in him, to whom I tolde the dreame, saying:
Dan.4.9	O Balthazar, thou prince of Sothesayers: For so moche as I knowe, that thou hast the sprete of the holy Goddes and no secrete is hyd from the. tell me therfore, what the vysyon of my dreame (that I haue sene) maye sygnifie.
Dan.4.10	I sawe a visyon in my heade vpon my bed: and beholde, there stode a tre vpon the grounde,
Dan.4.11	which was very hye, greate and myghtye: the heyght reached vnto the heauen, and the bredth extended to all the endes of the earth:
Dan.4.12	hys leaues were fayre, he had very moche frute, so that euery man had ynough to eate therin. The beastes of the felde had shadowes vnder it, and the foules of the ayre dwelt in the bowes therof. Shortly, all creatures fed of it.
Dan.4.13	I sawe in my head a visyon vpon my bed; Ꟶ behold, a watcher Ꟶ the holy one came downe from heauen,
Dan.4.14	Ꟶ cryed myghtely, saying. Hewe downe the tree, breake of his braunches, shake of his leaues, and scatre his frute abrode: that all the beastes maye get them awaye from vnder him, and the foules from his braunches.
Dan.4.15	Neuertheles, leaue the grounde of hys rote styll in the earth, Ꟶ bynde him vpon the playne felde, with cheynes of yron and stele. With the dewe of heauen shall he be wet, Ꟶ he shall haue hys parte in the herbes of the grounde with other wylde beastes.
Dan.4.16	That mans herte of his shall be taken from hym, and a beastes herte shall be geuen hym, tyll seuen yeares be come and gone vpon him.
Dan.4.17	This erande of the watcher, is a commaundment grounded and sought out in the councell of him, that is most holy: to learne men for to vnderstande, that the hyest hath power ouer the kyngdomes of men, Ꟶ geueth them, to whom it lyketh him, and bringeth the very out castes of men ouer them.
Dan.4.18	Thys is the dreame, that I kyng Nabuchodonosor haue sene. Therfore O Balthazar, tell thou me what it signifyeth: for so moch as all the wyse men of my kyngdome are not able to shewe me, what it meaneth. But thou canst do it, for the sprete of the holy Goddes is in the.
Dan.4.19	Then Daniel (whose name was Balthazar) helde hys peace by the space of an houre and hys thoughtes troubled hym. So the kynge spake Ꟶ sayde: O Balthazar, lett nether the dreame ner the interpretacyon therof feare the. Balthazar answered, saing: O my Lorde, this dreame happen to thyne enemies, and the interpretacyon to thyne aduersaries.
Dan.4.20	As for the tree that thou sawest which was so great Ꟶ myghtye, whose heygth reached vnto the heauen, and hys bredth into all the world:
Dan.4.21	whose leaues were fayre, and the frute moch: vnder the which the beastes of the felde had theyr habitacyon and vpon whose braunches the foules of the ayre dyd syt.
Dan.4.22	Euen thou (O kynge) art the tre, greate and stronge. Thy greatnes increaceth, Ꟶ reacheth vnto the heauen, so doth thy power to the endes of the earth.
Dan.4.23	But where as the kynge sawe a watcher euen an holy angell, that came downe from heauen, and sayde: hewe downe the tree, and destroye it: yet leaue the ground of the rote in the earth: and bynde hym vpon the playne felde with cheynes of yron Ꟶ stele: He shall be wet with the dewe of heauen, and hys parte shall be with the beastes of the felde, tyll seuen yeares be come and gone vpon hym:
Dan.4.24	Thys (O kynge) is the interpretacyon, yee, it is the very deuyce of hym, that is hyest of all and it toucheth my Lorde the kynge.
Dan.4.25	Thou shalt be cast out from men, and thy dwellinge shalbe with the beastes of the felde: with grasse shalt thou be fed lyke an oxe. Thou must be wet with the dewe of the heauen: yee, seuen yeares shall come, Ꟶ go vpon the, tyll thou knowe, that the hyest hath power vpon the kyngdomes of men, Ꟶ geueth them to whom he lyst.
Dan.4.26	Moreouer, where as it was sayde, that the rote of the tree shulde be left styll in the grounde: it betokeneth, that thy kyngdome shal remayne whole vnto the, after thou hast lerned to knowe, that the power commeth from heauen.
Dan.4.27	Wherfore, O kynge, be content with my councell, that thou mayest redeme thy synnes with almoyse and thyne offences with mercy to poore people: for thys shall be an helynge of thyne erroure.
Dan.4.28	All these thynges touche the, kynge Nabuchodonosor.
Dan.4.29	So after .xii. monethes, the kyng walked vp and downe in the palace of the kingdome of Babylon,
Dan.4.30	and sayde. Thys is the greate cyte of Babylon, which I my selfe (with my power and strength) haue made a kynges courte, for the honour of my magestye.
Dan.4.31	While these wordes were yet in the kynges mouth there fell a voyce from heauen, sayinge: O kynge Nabuchodonosor, to the be it spoken: Thy kyngdome shall departe from the,
Dan.4.32	thou shalt be cast out of mens company: thy dwellynge shalbe with the beastes of the felde, so that thou shalt eate grasse lyke as an oxe, tyll seuen yeares become and gone ouer the. euen vntyll thou knowest, that the hyest hath power vpon the kyngdomes of men, Ꟶ that he may geue them, vnto whom it pleaseth him.
Dan.4.33	The very same houre was thys matter fulfylled vpon Nabuchodonosor: so that he was cast out of mens company, and dyd eate grasse lyke an oxe. Hys body was wet with the dewe of heauen, tyll hys heares were as great as Aegles fethers, and hys nayles lyke byrdes clawes.
Dan.4.34	When thys tyme was past, I Nabuchodonosor lyfte vp myne eyes vnto heauen, and myne vnderstandinge was restored vnto me agayne. Then gaue I thanckes vnto the hyghest. I magnifyed and praysed him that lyueth for euermore, whose power endureth alwaye, and hys kyngdome from one generacyon to another:
Dan.4.35	in comparyson of whom all they that dwell vpon the earth, are to be reputed as nothynge. He handleth according to his will, among the powers of heauen Ꟶ amonge the inhabitours of the earth: and there is none that maye resyste his hande, or saye: what doest thou?
Dan.4.36	At the same tyme was myne vnderstandinge geuen me agayne, and I was restored to the honoure of my kingdome, to my dignite, and to myne awne shape agayne. My great estates and Princes sought vnto me, and I was set in my kyngdome agayne, so that I had yet greater worshyppe.
Dan.4.37	Then dyd I Nabuchodonosor, loue, magnifye and prayse the kynge of heauen: for all his worckes are true, and hys wayes ryght. As for those that go on proudly, he is able to brynge them downe.
Dan.5.1	Kynge Balthazar made a great bancket to his thousand Lordes: with all these thousande he made great chere,
Dan.5.2	and when he was droncken with wyne commaunded to bring hym the golden and syluer vessels which hys father Nabuchodonosor had taken oute of the temple at Ierusalem: that the kynge Ꟶ his Lordes with his quene and concubynes myght drincke therout.
Dan.5.3	So they brought the golden vessell, that was taken oute of the temple of the Lordes house at Ierusalem. Then the kynge and his Lordes with his quene and concubines droncke out of them.
Dan.5.4	They droncke wyne, and praysed theyr Idoles of golde, syluer, copper yron, wodde and stone.
Dan.5.5	In the very same houre there appeared fyngers, as it had bene of a mans hande writynge, ryght ouer agaynst the candelstycke vpon the playne wall in the kynges palace: Ꟶ the kynge sawe the palme of the hande that wrote.
Dan.5.6	Then chaunged the kynge his countenaunce, and his thoughtes troubled hym, so that the ioyntes of his body shoke, and hys knees smote one agaynst the other.
Dan.5.7	Wherfore the kinge cried myghtely, that they shulde brynge hym the charmers. Caldees and coniurers of deuels. The kynge spake also to the wyse men of Babylon, and sayde: Who so can rede this writing, Ꟶ shewe me the playne meaning therof: shalbe clothed with purple, haue a cheyne of golde aboute his necke, and rule the thyrde part of my kyngdome.
Dan.5.8	Upon this, came all the kinges wyse men: but they coulde nether reade the writynge, ner shewe the kinge what it signifyed.
Dan.5.9	Then was the kynge sore afrayed, in so moch, that hys coloure chaunged, and his Lordes were sore vexed.
Dan.5.10	So by reason of this matter, that had happened to the kynge Ꟶ his Lordes, the quene went vp herselfe into the bancket house, and spake vnto the kinge, sayinge: O kyng, God saue thy lyfe for euer. Let not the thoughtes trouble the, and let not thy countenaunce be chaunged.
Dan.5.11	For why? there is a man in thy kyngdome, that hath the sprete of the holy goddes within him, as it was sene in thy fathers dayes. He hath vnderstandynge and wysdome lyke the goddes. Ye the kynge Nabuchodonosor thy father made this man chefe of the sothsayers, charmers, Caldees and readers of destines:
Dan.5.12	because that soche an aboundaunt sprete, knowledge Ꟶ wysdome (to expounde dreames, to open secretes, and to declare harde dowtes) was founde in him: yee, euen in Daniel, whom the kyng named Balthasar. Let this same Daniel be sente for, and he shall tell, what it meaneth.
Dan.5.13	Then was Daniel brought before the kynge. So the kinge spake vnto Daniel, and sayde. Art thou that Daniel, one of the presoners of Iuda, whom my father the kynge brought out of Iewry?
Dan.5.14	I haue heard speake of the, that thou hast the sprete of the holy goddes, experience and vnderstandinge, and that there hath bene greate wysdome founde in the.
Dan.5.15	Nowe haue there bene brought me, wise Ꟶ conninge charmers, to reade thys wryting and to shewe me the meanynge therof. But they coulde not tell me, what thys matter signifyed
Dan.5.16	Then hearde I saye, that thou canst expounde darcke thynges, and declare harde doutes. Well than, yf thou canst reade thys wrytynge, Ꟶ shewe me the meanynge therof thou shalt be clothed wt purple, haue a cheyne of golde aboute thy necke, and rule the thyrd parte of my kyngdome.
Dan.5.17	Daniel answered, Ꟶ sayde before the kyng: As for thy rewardes, kepe them to thy selfe, or geue thy ryche gyftes to another: yet not the lesse, I will rede the wryting vnto the kyng, Ꟶ shewe him the interpretacyon therof
Dan.5.18	O kynge heare. God the hyest gaue vnto Nabuchodonosor thy father, the dignitie of a kyng with worshyppe Ꟶ honour,
Dan.5.19	so that all people, kinreddes Ꟶ tunges stode in awe and feare of hym, by reason of the hye estate, that he had lent hym. For why, he slewe whom he wolde: he smote, whom it pleased him. Agayne: whom he wolde, he set vp: and whom he lyst, he put downe.
Dan.5.20	But because his hert was so proude, and his stomack set so fast vnto wylfulnesse: he was deposed from his kyngly trone, Ꟶ hys magesty was taken from hym.
Dan.5.21	He was shut out from amonge men, hys herte was lyke a beastes herte, and hys dwellynge was with the wylde asses: he was fayne to eate grasse lyke an oxe, Ꟶ hys body was wet with the dewe of the heauen, tyll he knewe, that the hyest had power vpon the kyngdomes of men and setteth ouer them, whom he lyst.
Dan.5.22	And thou his sonne (O Balthazar) for all this, hast not submytted thyne herte, though thou knewest all these thinges:
Dan.5.23	but hast magnifyed thy selfe aboue the Lorde of heauen, so that the vessels of hys house were brought before the: that thou, and thy Lordes? with thy quene and concubynes, myght dryncke wyne therout. And hast praysed the Idoles of syluer and gold, copper and yron, of wodd and stone. As for the God in whose hande consysteth thy breth and all thy wayes: thou hast not loued hym.
Dan.5.24	Therfore is the palme of thys hande sent hyther from hym, to token vp this wryting.
Dan.5.25	And this is the scripture, that is written vp: Mane, Thetel, Phares.
Dan.5.26	Nowe the interpretacion of the thynge is this: Mane, God hath nombred the kyngdome, and brought it to an ende:
Dan.5.27	Thetel, thou art weyed in the balaunce, and art founde to lyght:
Dan.5.28	Phares, thy kyngdome it delt in partes, and geuen to the Medes and Perses.
Dan.5.29	Then commaunded Balthazar, to cloth Daniel wyth purple, to hange a cheyne of golde aboute hys necke, and to make a proclamacyon concernynge hym: that he shulde be the ruler of the thyrde parte of hys kyngdome.
Dan.5.30	The very same night was Balthazar the kynge of the Caldees slayne,
Dan.5.31	and Darius out of Medea toke in the kyngdome, beynge .lxii. yeare of age.
Dan.6.1	It pleased Darius to set ouer his kingdome an .C. and .xx. Lordes, whyche shulde be in all hys kyngdome about.
Dan.6.2	Aboue these he set thre Prynces (of whom Daniel was one) that the Lordes myght geue accomptes vnto them, and the kynge to be vndiseased.
Dan.6.3	But Daniel exceaded all these Prynces and Lordes, for the sprete of God was plenteous in him: so that the kynge was mynded to set hym ouer the whole realme.
Dan.6.4	Wherfore the Princes and Lordes sought, to pycke out in Daniel some quarell agaynst the kyngdome: yet coulde they fynde none occasyon ner faute vpon hym. For whyche was so faythfull, that there was no blame ner dishonesty founde in hym.
Dan.6.5	Then sayde these men: we wyll get no quarell agaynst thys Daniel, excepte it be in the lawe of hys God.
Dan.6.6	Upon this, wente the prynces Ꟶ Lordes together vnto the kinge, Ꟶ sayde thus vnto hym: kynge Darius, God saue thy lyfe for euer.
Dan.6.7	All the greate estates of the realme: as the Prynces, Dukes, Senatours and Iudges, are determed to put oute a commaundement of the kynge, Ꟶ to make a sure statute: namely, that whoso desyreth any peticyon, ether of any God or man (within this .xxx. dayes) excepte it be onely of the, O kynge: the same person may be cast into the Lyons denne.
Dan.6.8	Wherfore, O kyng, confyrme thou this statute, and make a wrytinge: that the thing which the Medes and Perses haue ordeyned be not altered ner broken.
Dan.6.9	So Darius made the wrytinge, and confyrmed it.
Dan.6.10	Nowe when Daniel vnderstode that the wrytinge was made, he wente into hys house: and the windowes of his wall towarde Ierusalem stode open. There kneled he downe vpon hys knees, thre tymes a daye: there he made hys peticyon, and praysed hys God, lyke as hys maner was to do afore tyme.
Dan.6.11	Then these men made searche, and founde Daniel makynge hys peticyon, Ꟶ prayinge vnto hys God.
Dan.6.12	So they came to the kynge, Ꟶ spake before him concernynge his commaundement, sayinge: O kyng, hast thou not subscribed the statute, that within .xxx. dayes who so requyreth his peticion of any God or man but onely of thy selfe, O kynge: he shalbe cast into the denne of the Lyons? The kynge answered, and sayde: yee, it is true. It must be as a lawe of the Medes Ꟶ Perses, that maye not be broken.
Dan.6.13	Then answered they, and sayde vnto the kynge: Daniel one of the presoners of Iuda O kyng, regardeth nether the, ner thy statute, that thou hast made, but maketh his peticyon thre tymes a daye.
Dan.6.14	When the kynge hearde these wordes, he was sore greued, and wolde haue excused Daniel, to delyuer hym, and put of the matter, vnto the Sunne went downe, to the intent that he myght saue hym:
Dan.6.15	These men perceauyng the kynges mynde, sayde vnto him: knowe this (O kynge) that the lawe of the Medes and Perses is, that the commaundement Ꟶ statute which the kynge maketh, maye not be altered.
Dan.6.16	Then the king bad them brynge Daniel, and they cast hym into the Lyons denne. The kynge also spake vnto Daniel, and sayde: thy God, whom thou alwaye seruest, euen he shall defende the.
Dan.6.17	And there was brought a stone, and layed vpon the hole of the denne: this the kyng sealed with his awne rynge, and with the sygnet of hys prynces: that the kynges commaundement concernynge Daniel, shulde not be broken.
Dan.6.18	So the kynge wente into hys palace, and eate no meate that nyght nether was there any mynstrelsy brought in before hym, nether coulde he take any slepe.
Dan.6.19	But by tymes in the mornynge at the breake of the daye, the kynge arose, and wente in all haste vnto the denne of the Lyons.
Dan.6.20	Nowe as he came nye vnto the denne, he cried with a piteous voyce vnto Daniel: yee, the kynge spake, and sayde vnto Daniel: O Daniel, thou seruaunt of the lyuinge God, is not thy God (whom thou alwaye seruest) able to delyuer the from the lyons?
Dan.6.21	Daniel sayde vnto the kinge. O kyng, God saue thy lyfe for euer.
Dan.6.22	My God hath sent his angell which hath shut the lyons mouthes, so that they might not hurte me. For why? mine vngyltynesse is founde out before hym. And as for the, O kynge, I neuer offended the.
Dan.6.23	Then was the kynge exceadinge glad, Ꟶ commaunded to take Daniel out of the denne, So Daniel was brought out of the denne, and no maner of hurte was founde vpon him. For he put hys trust in hys God.
Dan.6.24	And as for those men which had accused Daniel, the kyng, commaunded to brynge them, and to cast them in the Lyons denne: them, theyr chyldren and theyr wyues. So the Lyons had the mastry of them, and brake all theyr bones asonder, or euer they came at the grounde.
Dan.6.25	After thys, wrote kynge Darius vnto all people, kynreddes, and tunges, that dwelt in all landes: peace be multiplyed with you.
Dan.6.26	My commaundement is, in all my dominyon and kyngdome, that men feare and stande in awe of Daniels God. For he is the lyuynge God, which abydeth euer: hys kyngdome shall not fayle, and his power is euerlastinge.
Dan.6.27	It is he that delyuereth, and saueth: he doth wonders and maruelous worckes, in heauen and in earth: he hath preserued Daniel from the power of the Lyons.
Dan.6.28	This Daniel prospered in the reygne of Darius and Cyrus of Persia.
Dan.7.1	In the fyrst yeare of Balthazar kyng of Babylon; sawe Daniel a dreame, and a visyon was in hys heade vpon hys bedde. Which dreame he wrote, and the summe of the matter is thys.
Dan.7.2	Daniel spake and sayde: I sawe in my visyon by nyght, and beholde: the foure wyndes of the heauen stroue vpon the see,
Dan.7.3	and foure greate beastes came vp from the see, one vnlyke another.
Dan.7.4	The fyrst was as a lyon, and yet had he Aegles wynges. I sawe, that his wynges were plucte from hym, and he taken awaye from the earth: that he stode vpon hys fete as a man, and that there was geuen him a mans herte.
Dan.7.5	Beholde, the seconde beast was lyke a beare, Ꟶ stode vpon the one syde. Among his teeth in his mouth he had .iii. greate longe teeth, Ꟶ it was sayde vnto him. Aryse, eate vp, moch flesh.
Dan.7.6	Then I loked, and beholde, there was another lyke vnto a leoparde, this had wynges as a foule, euen foure vpon the backe. Thys beast had foure heades, and there was power geuen hym.
Dan.7.7	After this I sawe in a visyon by nyght, and beholde, the fourth beast was grymme and horrible, and maruelous stronge. It had great yron teeth, it deuoured and destroyed, and stamped the resydue vnder hys fete. It was farre vnlyke the other beastes that were before it: for it had ten hornes, wherof I toke good hede.
Dan.7.8	And beholde, there came vp amonge them, another lytell horne, before whom there were thre of the fyrst hornes pluckte awaye. Beholde, this horne had eyes lyke a man, and a mouth speakynge presumptuous thynges.
Dan.7.9	I loked tyll the seates were prepared, and tyll that olde aged sat him downe. His clothinge was as whyte as snowe, and the hearres of hys head lyke the pure woll. Hys trone was lyke the fyrye flame, and hys wheles as the burning fyre.
Dan.7.10	There drew forth a fyrie streame, and went out from hym. A thousande tymes a thousande serued him .x.M. tymes ten thousande stode before hym. The iudgement was set, and the bokes opened.
Dan.7.11	Then toke I hede there vnto, because of the voyce of the proude wordes, which the horne spake I behelde, tyll the beaste was slayne, and his body destroyed, geuen ouer to be brent in the fyre.
Dan.7.12	As for the power of the other beastes also it was taken awaye, but theyr lyues were prolonged for a tyme and season.
Dan.7.13	I sawe in a visyon by nyght, and beholde, there came one in the cloudes of heauen lyke the sonne of a man, which wente vnto the olde aged, before whom they brought him.
Dan.7.14	Then gaue he him power Ꟶ dignite regall, that all people, trybes and tunges shulde serue him. His power is an euerlastinge power, which shall neuer be put downe: Ꟶ his kyngdome endureth uncorrupte.
Dan.7.15	My herte was vexed, Ꟶ I Daniel had a troubled sprete within me. Ꟶ the visyons of my head made me afrayed:
Dan.7.16	tyll I gat me vnto one of them that stode by, to knowe the trueth, concernynge all these thinges. So he tolde me, and made me vnderstande the interpretacyon of the thynges.
Dan.7.17	These foure great beastes, are foure kynges which shall aryse out of the earth.
Dan.7.18	These shall take in the kyngdome of the saynctes of the most hyest, and possesse it styll more Ꟶ more for a longe season.
Dan.7.19	After thys I requyred diligently to knowe the trueth, concerning the fourth beast, which was so farre vnlyke the other beastes, and so horrible: whose teeth were of yron, and his nayles of brasse: which deuoured and destroyed and stamped the resydue vnder his fete.
Dan.7.20	I desyred, also to knowe the trueth, as touchynge the ten hornes that he had vpon his heade, and thys other which came vp afterwarde, before whose face there fell downe thre, which horne had eyes and a mouth that spake presumptuous thinges, and loked with a grymmer visage then hys felowes.
Dan.7.21	I behelde, and the same horne made battayll agaynst the saynctes, yee and gat the victory of them,
Dan.7.22	vntyll the tyme that the olde aged came, that the iudgement was geuen to the chefest saintes: and tyll the tyme that the sayntes had the kyngdome in possessyon.
Dan.7.23	He gaue me thys answere. That fourth beaste shalbe the fourth kyngdome vpon earth: it shalbe more then all other kyngdomes, it shall deuoure, treade downe, and destroye all other landes.
Dan.7.24	The ten hornes, are ten kynges, that shall aryse out of the kyngdome, after whom there shall stande vp another, which shalbe greater then the fyrst.
Dan.7.25	He shall subdue thre kynges, Ꟶ shall speake wordes agaynst the hyest of all: he shall destroye the sayntes of the most hyest, and thyncke, that he maye chaunge tymes and lawes. They shalbe geuen vnder hys power, vntyll a tyme, two tymes, Ꟶ halfe a tyme.
Dan.7.26	But the iudgement shalbe kepte, so that hys power shalbe taken from him, for he shall be destroyed, and peryssh at the last.
Dan.7.27	As for the kyngdome, power and all might that is vnder the heauen: it shalbe geuen to the holy people of the moost hyest, whose kyngdome is euerlastynge: yee, all powers shall serue and obeye hym.
Dan.7.28	Thus farre extende the wordes. Neuertheles, I Daniel was so vexed in my thoughtes, that my countenaunce chaunged but the wordes I kepte styll in my herte.
Dan.8.1	In the thyrde yeare of the raygne of kynge Balthazar, there appeared a visyon vnto me Daniel, after that I had sene the fyrst.
Dan.8.2	I sawe in a visyon (and when I sawe it, I was at Susis in the chefe cyte, which lyeth in the lande of Elam) and in the vision, me thought I was by the ryuer of Ulai.
Dan.8.3	Then I loked vp, Ꟶ sawe: Ꟶ beholde there stode before the ryuer, a ramme, which had two hornes: and these two hornes were hye, but one was hyer then another, Ꟶ the hyest came vp behinde.
Dan.8.4	I sawe that this ramme pushed with his hornes, agaynst the west, agaynst the north, Ꟶ agaynst the south: so that no beastes might stande before him, ner defende them from his power: but he dyd as hym lysted, and waxed greatly.
Dan.8.5	I toke hede vnto thys, Ꟶ then came there an he goate from the west ouer the whole earth, and touched not the grounde. Thys goate had a maruelous wrethen horne betwixte his eyes,
Dan.8.6	Ꟶ came vnto the ramme, that had the two hornes (whom I had sene afore by the ryuer syde) and ranne fearcely vpon him with his might.
Dan.8.7	I sawe him drawe nye vnto the ramme, beinge very fearce vpon hym: yee, he gaue hym soche a stroke, that he brake his two hornes. Nether had the ramme so moch strength as to stande before him: but he cast hym downe, troade hym vnder hys fete: Ꟶ no man was able to delyuer the ramme out of hys power.
Dan.8.8	The goate waxed exceadinge greate, and when he was at the strongest, his great, horne was broken also. Then grewe there other foure soch lyke in the steade, toward the .iiii. wyndes of the heauen.
Dan.8.9	Yee, out of one of the leest of these hornes, there came vp yet another horne, which waxed maruelous greate: towarde the south, towarde the east, and towarde the fayre pleasaunt lande.
Dan.8.10	It grewe vp to the hoost of heauen, wherof it dyd cast some downe to the grounde, and of the starres also, and trode them vnder fete.
Dan.8.11	Yee, it grewe vp vnto the prynce of the hoost, from whom the daylye offerynge was taken, and the place of hys Sanctuary casten downe.
Dan.8.12	And a certayne season was geuen vnto it, agaynst the daylye offeringe (because of wyckednesse) that it myght cast downe the veryte to the grounde, and so to prospere in all thynges, that it wente aboute.
Dan.8.13	Upon this I hearde one of the sainctes speakynge, which saynte sayde vnto one that asked this question. Howe longe shall this visyon of the daylye sacrifyce and of the wastinge abhominacyon endure: that the Sanctuary and the power shall so be troden vnder fote?
Dan.8.14	And he answered him: Unto the euenynge Ꟶ the mornynge, euen two thousande and thre hundreth dayes: then shall the Sanctuary be clensed agayne.
Dan.8.15	Nowe when I Daniel had sene this vision: and sought for the vnderstandynge of it: beholde, there stode before me a thinge like vnto a man.
Dan.8.16	And I herde a mans voyce in the riuer of Ulay, which cryed, and sayd: O Gabriel, make this man vnderstande the visyon.
Dan.8.17	So he came, and stode by me. But I was afrayed at hys commynge, and fell downe vpon my face. Then sayde he vnto me, O thou sonne of man, marcke well, for in the last tyme shall this vision be fulfylled.
Dan.8.18	Now as he was speakynge vnto me, I waxed faynte, so that I suncke downe to the grounde. But he toke holde vpon me, and sett me vp agayne,
Dan.8.19	sayinge: Beholde, I will shewe the, what shall happen in the last wrath: for in the tyme appoynted it shalbe fulfylled.
Dan.8.20	The ramme which thou sawest with the two hornes, is the kynge of the Medes and Perses:
Dan.8.21	but the goate is the kynge of Greke lande: the greate horne that stode betwyxte hys eyes, that is the principall kynge.
Dan.8.22	But where as it brake, and foure other rose vp in the steade: it signifyeth, that out of this people shall stande vp foure kyngdomes, but not so myghtye as it.
Dan.8.23	After these kyngdomes (whyle vngodlynesse is a growinge) there shall aryse a kyng of an vnshamefast face, whych shalbe wyse in darcke speakynges.
Dan.8.24	He shalbe myghtye and stronge, but not in his awne strength. He shall destroye aboue measure, and all that he goeth aboute shall prospere: he shall slaye the stronge and holy people.
Dan.8.25	And thorowe hys craftynes, falshed shall prospere in hys hande, hys herte shalbe proude, and many one shall he put to death in his welthynesse. He shall stande vp agaynst the Prynce of Prynces, but he shalbe destroyed wythout hande.
Dan.8.26	And thys visyon that is shewed vnto the, is as sure as the euenynge and the mornynge. Therfore wryte thou vp thys syght, for it wylbe longe or it come to passe.
Dan.8.27	Upon this was I daniel very faynte, so that I laye sycke certayne dayes: but when I rose vp, I wente aboute the kynges busynesse, and marueled at the visyon, neuerthelesse no man knewe of it.
Dan.9.1	In the fyrst yeare of Darius the sonne of Ahasuerus, whych was of the sede of the Medes, and was made kynge ouer the realme of the Caldees:
Dan.9.2	yee, euen in the fyrst yeare of his raygne, I Daniel desyred to knowe the yearly nombre out of the bokes, wherof the Lorde spake vnto Ieremy the Prophete: that Ierusalem shulde lye waste .lxx. yeares:
Dan.9.3	and I turned me vnto God the Lorde, for to praye and make myne intercession, with fastynge, sacke clothe Ꟶ ashes,
Dan.9.4	I prayed before the Lord my God, and knowledged, sayinge. O Lorde, thou greate and fearfull God, thou that kepest couenaunt and mercy wyth them, which loue the, and do thy commaundementes.
Dan.9.5	We haue synned, we haue offended, we haue bene disobedient and gone back: yee, we haue departed from all thy preceptes and iudgementes.
Dan.9.6	We wolde neuer folowe thy seruauntes the Prophetes that spake in thy name to oure kynges and princes, to oure forefathers, and to all the people of the lande.
Dan.9.7	O Lord, righteousnesse belongeth vnto the, vnto us pertayneth nothynge but open shame: as it is come to passe thys daye vnto euery man of Iuda, and to them that dwell at Ierusalem. Yee, vnto all Israel, whether they be farre or nye: thorowe out all landes: wherin thou hast strowed them, because of the offences, that they had done agaynst the.
Dan.9.8	Yee, O Lorde, vnto vs, to oure kynges Ꟶ princes, to oure forefathers: euen to vs all, that haue offended the belongeth open shame.
Dan.9.9	But vnto the, O Lorde oure God, pertayneth mercy and forgeuenesse. As for vs, we are gone backe from hym,
Dan.9.10	and haue not obeyed the voyce of the Lorde oure God, to walke in hys lawes, whych he layed before vs by hys seruauntes the Prophetes:
Dan.9.11	yee all Israel haue transgressed, and gone backe from thy lawe, so that they haue not herckened vnto thy voyce. Wherfore, the curse Ꟶ othe that is written in the lawe of Moses the seruaunt of God (agaynst whom we haue offended) is poured vpon vs.
Dan.9.12	And he hath perfourmed his wordes, whych he spake agaynst vs, Ꟶ agaynst oure iudges that iudged vs: to brynge vpon vs soch a greate plage, as neuer was vnder heauen, lyke as it is nowe come to passe in Ierusalem.
Dan.9.13	Yee, all this plage, as it is wrytten in the lawe of Moses, is come vpon vs. Yet made we not oure prayer before the Lorde oure God, that we myght turne agayne from oure wickednesse, Ꟶ to be learned in thy verite.
Dan.9.14	Therfore hath the Lorde made haste, to brynge this plage vpon vs, for the Lorde our God is ryghteous, in all his workes whych he doth: for why? We wolde not herken vnto hys voyce.
Dan.9.15	And nowe, O Lorde oure God thou that with a myghtie hande hast brought thy people out of Egypte, to get thy selfe a name which remayneth this daye: we haue synned
Dan.9.16	O Lorde, Ꟶ done wyckedly agaynst all thy ryghteousnes: yet let thy wrothfull displeasure be turned awaye (I beseche the) from thy cyte Ierusalem thy holy hyll. And why? for oure synnes sake, and for the wykednesse of oure forefathers is Ierusalem Ꟶ thy people abhorred, of all them that are aboute vs:
Dan.9.17	Now therfore, O our God, heare the prayer of thy seruaunt, and hys intercessyon. O let thy face shyne ouer thy Sanctuary, that lyeth waste:
Dan.9.18	for the Lordes sake. O my God, enclyne thyne eare, and herken (at the leest for thyne awne sake) open thyne eyes: beholde howe we be desolated, yee, and the cytie also, whych is called after thy name: for we do not cast oure prayers before the in oure awne ryghteousnes, no: but onely in thy great mercyes:
Dan.9.19	O Lorde, heare: O forgeue Lorde, O Lorde consydre, tarye not ouer longe: but for thyne awne sake do it. O my God: for thy cyte and thy people is called after thy name.
Dan.9.20	As I was yet speakynge at my prayers, knowledgynge myne awne synnes, and the synnes of my people, makynge so myne intercessyon before the Lorde my God, for the holy hylles sake of my God:
Dan.9.21	yee, whyle I was yet speakynge in my prayer, beholde, the man Gabriel. (whom I had sene afore in the visyon) came flyinge to me, and touched me aboute the offering tyme in the euenynge.
Dan.9.22	He infourmed me, Ꟶ spake vnto me: O Daniel sayde he, I am nowe come to make the vnderstande it.
Dan.9.23	For as soone as thou begannest to make thy prayer, it was so diuised, Ꟶ therfore am I come to shewe the. And why? For thou art a man greatly beloued. Wherfore, pondre the matter well, that thou mayest learne, to vnderstande the visyon.
Dan.9.24	.Lxx. wekes are determed ouer thy people, and ouer the holy cytie: that the wyckednes maye be consumed, that the synne may haue an ende, that the offence maye be reconciled, and to brynge in euerlastinge ryghteousnesse, to fulfyll the visyons and the prophetes, and to anoynte the moost holy one.
Dan.9.25	Understande this then, and marcke it well: that from the tyme it shalbe concluded to go and repayre Ierusalem agayne, vnto Christ (or the anoynted) prince: there shalbe seuen wekes: Then shall the stretes and walles be buylded agayne .lxij. wekes, but with harde troublous tyme.
Dan.9.26	After these .lxij. wekes, shall Christ be slayne, and they shall haue no pleasure in hym. Then shall there come a people with the Prince, and destroye the cyte Ꟶ the Sanctuary: and hys ende shall come as the water floude. But the desolacyon shall contynue tyll the ende of the battell.
Dan.9.27	He shall make a stronge bonde with many, for the space of a weke: Ꟶ when the weke is halfe gone, he shall put downe the slayne and meatoffringe. And in the temple there shalbe an abhominable desolacyon, tyll it haue destroyed all. And it is concluded, that this wastynge shall contynue vnto the ende.
Dan.10.1	In the thyrde yeare of kynge Cirus of Persia, there was shewed vnto Daniel (other wyse called Balthasar) a matter, yee, a true matter, but it is yet a longe tyme vnto it. He vnderstode the matter well, and perceaued what the visyon was.
Dan.10.2	At the same tyme, I Daniel mourned for the space of thre wekes,
Dan.10.3	so that I had no lust to eate bread: as for fleshe and wyne there came none wythin my mouth: No, I dyd not once anoynte my self, tyl the wole thre wekes were out.
Dan.10.4	Upon the .xxiiij. daye of the first moneth, I was by the greate floude, called Tygris
Dan.10.5	I lyft vp myne eyes, and loked: and beholde, a man clothed in lynen, whose loynes were gyrded vp with fyne golde of Araby:
Dan.10.6	his body was lyke the Chrysolite stone, hys face (to loke vpon) was lyke lyghtenynge, hys eyes as the flame of fyre, hys armes and fete were lyke fayre glysterynge metall, but the voyce of his wordes was lyke the voyce of a multitude.
Dan.10.7	I Daniel alone sawe thys visyon the men that were wyth me, sawe it not: but a greate fearfulnesse fell vpon them, so that they fled awaye, and hyd them selues.
Dan.10.8	I was left there my selfe alone, and sawe this great visyon, so longe tyll there remayned nomore strength wythin me: yee, I lost my coloure clene, I wasted awaye, and my strength was gone.
Dan.10.9	Yet hearde I the voyce of hys wordes: and as soone as I hearde it, fayntnesse came vpon me; and I fell downe flat to the grounde vpon my face.
Dan.10.10	And behold, an hande touched me, whych set me vp vpon my knees Ꟶ vpon the palmes of my handes,
Dan.10.11	sayinge vnto me. O Daniel, thou well beloued man: take good hede of the wordes, that I shall saye vnto the, and stande ryght vp, for vnto the am I nowe sent. And when he had sayde these wordes, I stode vp tremblynge.
Dan.10.12	Then sayde he vnto me: feare not Daniel: for why, sence the fyrst daye that thou set thyne herte to vnderstande, and dydest chasten thy selfe before thy God: thy wordes haue bene herde. And I had come vnto the. When thou begannest to speake
Dan.10.13	had not the prynce ouer the kyngdom of the Perses wythstande me .xxj. dayes. But lo, Michael one of the chefe prynces, came to helpe and I was left to contynue ther with the kinges of Persia,
Dan.10.14	Ꟶ am come to shewe the, what shall happen vnto thy people in the latter dayes. For it wylbe longe yet or the visyon be fulfylled.
Dan.10.15	Nowe when he had spoken these wordes vnto me, I cast downe my head to the grounde and helde my tunge.
Dan.10.16	Beholde, there touched my lyppes one very lyke vnto a man. Then opened I my mouth, and sayde vnto him, that stode before me, O my Lorde, my ioyntes are lowsed in the visyon, and there is nomore strength within me.
Dan.10.17	Howe may my Lordes seruaunt then talke wyth my Lord? seynge there is no strength in me, so that I cannot take my breth?
Dan.10.18	Upon this there touched me agayne, one moch lyke a man and conforted me,
Dan.10.19	sayinge. O thou man so well beloued, feare not: be content, take a good hert vnto the, and be stronge. So when he had spoken vnto me, I recouered, and sayde. Speake on my Lord, for thou hast refreshed me.
Dan.10.20	Then sayd he: knowest thou wherfore I am come vnto the? nowe wyll I go agayne to fyght wyth the prince of the Perses. As soone as I go forth, lo, the prince of Grekelande shall come.
Dan.10.21	Neuertheles, I wyll shewe the that thynge, that is fast noted in the scrypture of trueth. And as for all yonder matters, there is none that helpeth me in them, but Michael youre prynce.
Dan.11.1	And in the fyrst yeare of Darius of Media, I stode by hym, to comforte him, and to strength hym,
Dan.11.2	Ꟶ nowe wyll I shewe the trueth. Beholde, there shall stande vp yet thre kynges in Persia, but the fourth shalbe farre rycher then they all. And when he is in the chefest power of hys ryches, he shall prouoke euery man agaynst the realme of Grekelande.
Dan.11.3	Then shall there aryse yet a myghtye kynge, that shall rule wyth greate dominion, and do what hym lyst.
Dan.11.4	And as soone as hys kyngdome cometh vp, it shalbe destroyed, and deuyded towarde the foure wyndes of the heauen. They that come after hym, shall not haue soche power Ꟶ dominyon as he: but hys kyngdome shalbe scatred, yee, euen amonge other then those.
Dan.11.5	And the kyng of the south shalbe myghtyer, then his other princes. And one shall be stronger then he, Ꟶ shall rule hys dominyon wyth greate power.
Dan.11.6	And in the ende of yeares they shalbe ioyned together, and the kynges daughter of the southe shall come to the kynge of the North, for to make frendshyppe, but she shall not optayne the power of that arme, nether shall she be able to endure thorowe his myght: but she, and soch as brought her (yee and he that begat her, and conforted her for hys tyme) shalbe delyuered vp.
Dan.11.7	Out of the braunches of her rote, there shall one stande vp in hys steade: whych with power of armes shall go thorowe the kynges lande of the north, and handle hym accordynge to hys strength. As for their Idols and princes, with their costly Iewels of golde and syluer,
Dan.11.8	he shall cary them awaye captyues into Egypte, and he shall reygne more yeares then the kynge of the north.
Dan.11.9	And when he is come into the kynges realme of the south, he shalbe fayne to turne agayne into hys awne lande.
Dan.11.10	Wherfore hys sonnes shalbe displeased, Ꟶ shall gather together a myghtye greate hoost of people: and one of them shall come, and go thorowe lyke a water flowde: then shall he returne, and go forthwith defyinge and boastynge vnto his awne lande.
Dan.11.11	Then the kynge of the south shalbe angry and shall come forth to fight against the kynge of the north: yee, he shall brynge a greate multitude of people together, and a greate heape shalbe geuen into his hande:
Dan.11.12	these shall he cary awaye wyth greate pryde, for so moche as he hath cast downe so many thousandes, neuertheles, he shall not preuayle.
Dan.11.13	For the kyng of the north shall gather (of the new) a greater heape of people then afore, and come forth (after a certayne tyme Ꟶ yeares) wyth a myghtye hooste and exceadynge greate good.
Dan.11.14	At the same tyme there shall many stande vp agaynst the kynge of the south, so that the wycked chyldren of thy people also shall exalte them selues (to fulfyll the vision) Ꟶ then fall.
Dan.11.15	So the kinge of the north shall come to laye sege, and to take the strong fensed cyties: And the power of them of the south shall not be able to abyde him, and the best men of the people shall not be so strong, as to resyst hym.
Dan.11.16	Shortely, when he commeth, he shall handle hym as he lyst, Ꟶ no man shalbe so hardy as to stande agaynst hym. He shall stande in the pleasaunt countre, whych thorowe him shalbe destroyed.
Dan.11.17	He shall set hys face wyth all hys power to optayne hys kyngdom, and to be lyke it. Yee, that shall he do, and geue him vnto the daughters amonge wemen, to destroye hym. But he shall fayle, nether shall he optayne hys purpose.
Dan.11.18	After thys shall he set hys face vnto the. Iles and take many of them. A prince shall stoppe hym, to do him a shame, besyde the confusyon that els shall come vnto him.
Dan.11.19	Thus shall he tourne agayne to hys awne lande, stomble and fall, and be nomore founde:
Dan.11.20	so be that came vpon hym Ꟶ dyd hym violence, shall stande in hys place, haue a pleasaunt kyngdome: and after fewe dayes he shalbe destroyed, Ꟶ that nether in wrath, ner in battell.
Dan.11.21	In hys steade there shall aryse a vyle person, not holden worthy of a kynges dignytie: this shall come in peaceably, and optayne the kyngdome wyth fayre wordes:
Dan.11.22	he shall fyght agaynst the armes of the myghtye (and destroye them) yee, and agaynst the prince of the couenaunt.
Dan.11.23	So after that he hath taken truce wyth him, he shall handle disceatfully: that he maye get vp, and ouercome hym with a small flocke:
Dan.11.24	and so with craftynesse to get him to the fattest place of the lande, and to deale otherwyse, then ether his fathers or graundfathers dyd. For he shall destroye the thynge, that they had robbed Ꟶ spoyled, yee, and all theyr substaunce: ymagenynge thoughtes agaynst the stronge holdes, and that for a tyme.
Dan.11.25	Hys power and herte shalbe sterred vp wyth a greate armye agaynst the kinge of the south where thorowe the kynge of the south shalbe moued then vnto battell, with a greate Ꟶ myghtye hoost also. Neuerthelesse, he shall not be able to stande, for they shall conspyre against him.
Dan.11.26	Yee, they that eate of his meate shall hurte hym: so that his hoost shall fall, Ꟶ many be slayne downe.
Dan.11.27	These two kynges shalbe mynded to do myschefe, and talke of disceate at one table: but they shall not prospere, for why, the ende shall not come yet, vnto the tyme apoynted
Dan.11.28	Then shall he go home agayne into hys awne lande with great good, and set his hert agaynst the holy couenaunt, he shalbe busye agaynst it, and then returne home.
Dan.11.29	At the time apoynted he shall come agayne, and go towarde the south. So shall it happen otherwyse then at the fyrst, yet ones agayne.
Dan.11.30	And why? the shyppes with Italyans shall come vpon him, that he may be smytten and turne agayne: that he may take indignacion against the couenaunt of holynesse, to medle agaynst it. Yee, he shall turne him, and drawe soch vnto him, as leaue the holy couenaunt.
Dan.11.31	He shall set myghtye men to vnhalowe the Sanctuary of strength, to put downe the daylye offeringe, and to set vp the abhominable desolacyon.
Dan.11.32	And soch as breake the couenaunt shall he flatter wyth fayre wordes. But the people that wyll knowe their God, shall haue the ouerhande and prospere.
Dan.11.33	Those also that haue vnderstandinge among the people shall enfourme the multitude: and for a longe season, they shalbe persecuted wyth swearde, with fyre, wyth captiuite Ꟶ wyth the takynge awaye of theyr goodes.
Dan.11.34	Nowe when they fall, they shalbe sett vp wyth a lytle helpe: but many shall cleue vnto them faynedly.
Dan.11.35	Yee some of those which haue vnderstandyng shall be persecuted also, that they may be tryed, purifyed and clensed, tyll the tyme be out: for there is yet another time appoynted.
Dan.11.36	The kynge shall do what hym lyst he shall exalte and magnifye him selfe agaynst all that is God. Yee, he shall speake maruelous thinges agaynst the God of all goddes wherin he shall prospere, so longe tyll the wrath be fulfylled, for the conclusyon is deuised alredy.
Dan.11.37	He shall not regarde the God of hys fathers, but his lust shall be vpon wemen. Yee, he shall not care for eny God, for he shall magnifye him selfe aboue all.
Dan.11.38	In hys place shall he worshype the myghtie stoute God: and the God whom his fathers knewe not, shall be honoure with golde and syluer, with precious stones and pleasaunt Iewels.
Dan.11.39	This shall he do, thorowe hys stronge fensed places, settinge vpe hys straunge God whom he confessith and encreasinge his glorye. Soche as will receaue hym, Ꟶ take hym for God, he shall geue them greate worshyppe and power: yee, and make them Lordes of the multitude, and geue them the lande with rewardes.
Dan.11.40	In the latter tyme shall the kynge of the south stryue wyth him: and the kynge of the north in lyke maner shall come against him with charettes, horsmen and wt a greate nauy of shyppes. He shall come into the landes, destroye and go thorowe:
Dan.11.41	he shall entre also into the fayre pleasaunt lande: Many cyties and countres shall decaye excepte Edom, Moab and the best of the chyldren of Ammon, whych shall escape from hys hande.
Dan.11.42	He shall stretch forth his handes vpon the countrees, Ꟶ the lande of Egypte shall not escape hym.
Dan.11.43	For thorowe his goynge in, he shall haue dominion ouer the treasures of syluer and golde, and ouer all the precious Iewels of Egypt, Libia and Ethiopia.
Dan.11.44	Neuerthelesse, the tydynges out of the East and the north shall trouble him, for the whych cause he shall goo forth to destroye and rote owte a greate multitude.
Dan.11.45	The tentes of hys palace shall be pytched betwyxte the two sees, vpon the hyll of the noble Sanctuary, for he shall come to his dethe, and then shall no man helpe hym.
Dan.12.1	The tyme wyll come also, that the great prince Michael, which standeth on thy peoples side, shal aryse vp, for there shall come a tyme of trouble, soch as neuer was, sens there began to be eny people, vnto that same tyme. Then shall thy people be delyuered, yee, all those that be founde wrytten in the boke.
Dan.12.2	Many of them that slepe in the dust of the earth, shall awake: some to the euerlastynge lyfe, some to perpetuall shame Ꟶ reprofe.
Dan.12.3	The wyse (soch as haue taught other) shall glyster, as the shynynge of heauen: and those that haue instructe the multitude vnto godlynesse, shalbe as the starres, worlde without ende.
Dan.12.4	And thou O Daniel, shut vp these wordes, and seale the boke tyll the last time Many shall go aboute here and there, and then shall knowledge increase.
Dan.12.5	So I Daniel loked, Ꟶ beholde, there stode other two: one vpon thys shore of the water, the other vpon yonder syde.
Dan.12.6	And one of them sayd vnto hym, which was clothed in lynen and stode aboue vpon the waters of the floude. How longe shall it be to the ende of these wonderous worckes?
Dan.12.7	Then herde I the man wyth the lynen clothes, which stode aboue vpon the waters of the floude: when he helde vp hys ryght and left hande vnto heauen, and sware by hym whych lyueth for euer that it shall tary for a tyme, two tymes and halfe a tyme: Ꟶ when the power of the holy people is clene scatred abrode, then shall all these thynges be fulfylled.
Dan.12.8	I herde it well, but I vnderstode it not. Then sayde I: O my Lord, what shall happen after that?
Dan.12.9	He answered: Go thy waye Daniel, for these wordes shall be closed vp Ꟶ sealed, tyll the last tyme:
Dan.12.10	and many shalbe purifyed, clensed Ꟶ tryed. But the vngodly shall lyue wyckedly and those wicked (as many of them as they be) shall haue no vnderstandynge. As for soch as haue vnderstanding, they shall regarde it.
Dan.12.11	And from the tyme forth that the daylye offerynge shalbe put downe Ꟶ the abhominable desolation sett vp, there shalbe a .M.CCXC: daies
Dan.12.12	O well is hym, that wayteth, Ꟶ cometh to the thousande.iij.C. and .xxxv. dayes.
Dan.12.13	Go thou thy waye nowe tyll it be ended: take thy rest, and hyde thy lot, tyll the dayes haue an ende.
