Neh.0.0	{¶ The seconde boke of Esdras, otherwyse called the boke of Nehemia}
Neh.1.1	The wordes of Nehemia the sonne of Hachalia. It fortuned in the moneth Chisleu in the twentie yere, that I was in the castell at Susan:
Neh.1.2	Ꟶ Hanani one of my brethren came with certayne men of Iuda, and I asked them how the Iewes dyd that were delyuered an escaped from the captyute, and how it went at Ierusalem.
Neh.1.3	And they sayde vnto me: The remnaunt of the captyuyte are there in the lande in greate misfortune and rebuke. The wall of Ierusalem also is broken downe, and the gates therof are brent with fyre.
Neh.1.4	It fortuned, that when I hearde these wordes, I sat me downe and wepte, and mourned certayne dayes, Ꟶ fasted, Ꟶ prayed before the God of heauen,
Neh.1.5	Ꟶ sayde, O Lorde God of heauen, thou greate Ꟶ terrible God, thou that kepest couenaunt and mercy for them that loueth the, and obserue thy commaundementes:
Neh.1.6	let thyne eares hearken, I beseche the, and let thyne eyes be open, that thou mayest heare the prayer of thy seruauntes, whych I praye now before the, daye Ꟶ nyghte, for the chyldren of Israel thy seruauntes, and knowledge the synnes of the chyldren of Israel, which we haue synned agaynst the. I and my fathers house haue synned.
Neh.1.7	We haue bene vtterly dispersed from thy lawe, and haue not kepte the commaundementes, statutes and lawes, which thou commaundedst thy seruaunt Moses.
Neh.1.8	I besech the, call to remembraunce the worde that thou commaundedst thy seruaunt Moses, Ꟶ saydest: Ye wyll transgresse, and I will scater you abroade among the nacions.
Neh.1.9	But yf ye turne vnto me, and kepe my commaundementes Ꟶ do them: though ye were cast out vnto the vttermost parte of heauen, yet will I gather you from thence, and wyll brynge you vnto the place, that I haue chosen to set my name there.
Neh.1.10	They are thy seruauntes, and thy people, whom thou hast deliuered thorowe thy great power Ꟶ in thy myghtie hand.
Neh.1.11	O Lord, I besech the, let thyne eare herken to the prayer of thy seruaunt, and to the prayer of thy seruauntes, whose desyre is to feare thy name, and let thy seruaunt prospere this daye, and graunte hym mercy in the syght of thys man: for I was the kynges buttelar.
Neh.2.1	It fortuned, that in the moneth Nisan in the twentyeth yeare of kynge Arthaxerses, the wyne stode before hym, and I toke vp the wyne, and gaue it vnto the kynge, and I was heuy in his presence.
Neh.2.2	And the kyng sayde vnto me: why lokest thou so sadly, whan thou art not sycke? it is nothynge els, but that thou art heuy herted. And I was sore afrayed,
Neh.2.3	and sayed vnto the kynge: God saue the kynges life for euer. How shulde I not loke sadly, whan the cytie and place of my fathers buryall lyeth waste, and the gates therof are so consumed with fyre?
Neh.2.4	And the kyng sayde vnto me: what is then thy request? I made my prayer also to the God of heauen,
Neh.2.5	and sayde vnto the kyng: yf it please the kyng, and yf thy seruaunt haue founde fauoure in thy syghte, sende me into Iuda vnto the cytie of my fathers buryall, that I maye buylde it.
Neh.2.6	And the kynde sayde vnto me (the quene his wyfe sytting by him) howe longe shall thy iourney continue, and when wylt thou come agayne? And it pleased the kynge to sende me, and I sett him a tyme,
Neh.2.7	Ꟶ sayde vnto the kyng: yf it please the kyng, let him geue me letters to the captaynes which are beyonde the water, that they maye conuaye me ouer, tyll I come into Iuda:
Neh.2.8	and letters vnto Asaph the Lord of the kinges wood, that he maye geue me tymber to make beames for the gates of the palace (which is harde by the house) Ꟶ for the walles of the cytie, and for the house that I shall entre into. And the kynge gaue me accordinge to the hande of my God, which was good vpon me.
Neh.2.9	And when I came to the captaynes beyonde the water, I gaue them the kynges letters And the kynge had sent captaynes and horsmen with me.
Neh.2.10	Sanabalat also the Horonite and Tobia a seruaunt (the Ammonite) hearde of it, and it greued them sore, that there was come a man which soughte the welth of the chyldren of Israel.
Neh.2.11	And I came to Ierusalem, Ꟶ was there thre dayes,
Neh.2.12	and I gat me vp in the night season, and a fewe men with me: nether tolde I anye man, what God had geuen me in my hert to be at Ierusalem: and there was not one beast with me saue it that I rode vpon.
Neh.2.13	And I departed in the nyghte by the valley porte, before the Dragon well, Ꟶ to the Donge porte, and considered the walles of Ierusalem, how they were broken downe, and the portes therof consumed with the fyre.
Neh.2.14	And I went ouer vnto the wellporte, and to the kynges condyte, and there was no rowme for the beast that was vnder me, to passe.
Neh.2.15	Then wente I on in the nyght by the brooke syde and consydered the wall, and turned backe, and came home agayne by the valley porte.
Neh.2.16	And the rulers knewe not whither I wente or what I dyd: neyther dyd I as yet tell it vnto the Iewes, to the preastes, to the noble men, to the rulers, and to the other that laboured in the worcke.
Neh.2.17	Then sayde I vnto them: ye se the miserye that we are in, how Ierusalem lyeth waste, and how the gates therof are brent with fyre: come therfore, that we maye buylde vp the wall of Ierusalem, Ꟶ that we be no more a rebuke.
Neh.2.18	And I told them of the hande of my God, (that it was gracious ouer me) and the kynges wordes that he had spoken vnto me. And they sayde: let us get vp and buylde: and they strengthed their hande to goode.
Neh.2.19	But when Sanabalat the Horonite, and Tobia the seruaunt (an Ammonite,) and Gesem the Arabian herde it, they laughed vs to skorne, and mocked vs, and sayde: what is thys that ye do? Wyll ye fall awaye from the kynge?
Neh.2.20	Then answered I them, and sayde: the God of heauen, he it is that hath graunted vs prosperite: and we be his seruauntes. Let vs get up and buylde. As for you, ye haue no porcyon nor right, nor remembraunce in Ierusalem.
Neh.3.1	And Eliasib the hie preast gat him vp with hys brethren the preastes, Ꟶ they buylded the Shepegate. They repayred it, Ꟶ set vp that dores of it: euen vnto the tower Mea repayred they it, and vnto the tower of Hananeel.

He buylded it, and layed the beames, and set on the dores, lockes, and barres therof, and the wall vnto the pole of Siloah by the kynges garden, and vnto the steppes that go downe from the cytie of Dauid.
Neh.3.16	After him buylded Nehemiah the sonne of Afbok, the ruler of the halfe parte of Bethzur, vntyll the other syde ouer agaynst the sepulchres of Dauid, and to the pole that was repayred, and vnto the house of the myghtie.

Neh.3.19	and after hym buylded Ezer the sonne of Iesua the ruler of Mispa the other pece, harde ouer agaynst the goynge vp to the house of ordinaunce that was in the corner.
Neh.3.20	Agayne, after hym brake forth Baruch the sonne of zachai of indignacyon, and repayred the other pece from the turnyng corner vnto the dore of the house of Eliasib the hye prest.
Neh.3.21	After hym also buylded Merimoth the sonne of Uria the sonne of Hacos the other pece, from the dore of the house of Eliasib, euen as longe as the house of Eliasib extended.

Neh.3.27	After hym buylded they of Thekua the other pece ouer agaynst the greate tower, that lyeth outwarde, vnto the wall of the stronge holde.
Neh.3.28	But from aboue the Horsgate forth, buylded the preastes, euery one ouer agaynst his house.
Neh.3.29	And after them buylded zadok the sonne of Immer ouer agaynst his house. After hym buylded also Semeia the sonne of Sechania the keper of the Eastgate.

Neh.3.32	And betwene the parlour of the corner vnto the Shepegate buylded the goldsmytes and the merchauntes.
Neh.4.1	But when Sanabalat heard that we buylded the wall, he was wroth in hym selfe, and toke greate indignacion, Ꟶ mocked the Iewes,
Neh.4.2	and sayde before his brethren Ꟶ the souldyers of Samaria: what do these impotent Iewes? wyll the hethen suffre them? shall they offre? shall they perfourme it in one daye? shal they make the stones whole agayne that are brought to dust, and brent?
Neh.4.3	And Tobiah the Ammonite was besyde him, and sayde: Though they buylde, yet yf a foxe go vp, he shall breake downe theyr stonye wall.
Neh.4.4	Heare (O thou oure God) for we are despised, turne their shame vpon their awne heade, Ꟶ geue them ouer into despisynge in the lande of their captiuite.
Neh.4.5	Couer not their wickednesse, Ꟶ let not their synne be put out in thy presence: for they haue prouoked the buylders.
Neh.4.6	And so buylded we the wall, Ꟶ it was ioyned whole together, vnto the half heygth therof. And the people were mynded to laboure.
Neh.4.7	And it fortuned, that when Sanabalat, and Tobiah, Ꟶ the Arabians, Ammonites, Ꟶ Asoodites heard, that the walles of Ierusalem were mad vp, and that the gappes beganne to be stopped, they were very wroth,
Neh.4.8	Ꟶ conspired all together to come, Ꟶ fyght against Ierusalem, and to make the people an hynderaunce therin.
Neh.4.9	Neuertheles, we made our prayer vnto our God, Ꟶ set watchmen by them, which buylded daye Ꟶ nyght ouer agaynst them.
Neh.4.10	And Iuda sayd: the strength of the bearers is to feble, Ꟶ there is yet moch more morter, Ꟶ we are not able to buyld on the wall.
Neh.4.11	And our aduersaries sayd: they shall not knowe nether se, tyll we come in the middes amonge them, and slaye them, and hinder the worcke.
Neh.4.12	But it fortuned that when the Iewes (which dwelt besyde them) came, they tolde vs as good as ten tymes, that in all places where ye go vnto, they are appointed to fal vpon vs.
Neh.4.13	Therfore set I the people after their kinredes wt their swerdes, speares Ꟶ bowes beneth in the lowe places behynd the wal,
Neh.4.14	Ꟶ I loked, Ꟶ gat me vp, Ꟶ sayd vnto the chefe men, to the rulers, Ꟶ to the other people, be not ye afrayed of them, but thincke rather vpon the greate Lord, whych ought to be feared, Ꟶ fight for your brethren, your sonnes, yor daughters, your wiues, Ꟶ your houses.
Neh.4.15	Neuertheles, it chaunced that when our enemies hearde, that we had gotten worde of it. God brought their councel to naught, Ꟶ we turned all againe to the wal, euery one vnto his labor.
Neh.4.16	And from that time forth it came to passe that the half parte of the yong men did the laboure, Ꟶ the other half parte of them helde the speares, shyldes, bowes, and brestplates: Ꟶ the rulers stode behynde all the house of Iuda,
Neh.4.17	which buylded on the wall, and bare burthens from those that laded them. With one hande dyd euery one worcke, Ꟶ wt the other helde he hys weapen.
Neh.4.18	And euery one that buylded, had his swerd, gyrde by hys thygh, and so buylded they. And the trompet blewe besyde me.
Neh.4.19	And I sayd vnto the principal men, to the rulers, and to the other people: the worke is great and large, Ꟶ we are separated vpon the wall one farre from another.
Neh.4.20	Loke in what place therfore ye heare the noyse of the trompet, resorte ye thyther vnto vs, Ꟶ our God shal fight for vs,
Neh.4.21	Ꟶ we will be labouryng in the worcke. And the halfe part of them helde the speares from the mornyng spryng, tyll the starres came forth.
Neh.4.22	And at the same tyme said I vnto the people: euery one abyde with hys seruaunt at Ierusalem, that in the night season we maye watch, and labour on the daye tyme.
Neh.4.23	As for me and my brethren, my seruauntes, and the men of the watch (which were behynde me) we put neuer of oure clothes, nomore then the other dyd theyr harnesse, saue onely because of the water.
Neh.5.1	And there arose a great complaynte of the people, and of theyr wyues agaynst their brethren the Iewes.
Neh.5.2	For there were some that sayd: our sonnes and daughters and we are to many, therfore wyll we take corne for them, that we maye eate, and lyue.
Neh.5.3	Some also there were that sayde: let vs sett our landes, vyneyardes and houses to pledge, and take vp corne in the darth.
Neh.5.4	But som there were that sayde: let vs borowe money for the kynges trybute Ꟶ that vpon our landes and vyneardes.
Neh.5.5	Behold, oure bodyes as the bodyes of oure brethren, and oure chyldren as theyr chyldren: elles shulde we subdue our sonnes and daughters vnto bondage, and some of oure daughters are subdued vnto bondage all ready, Ꟶ no strength is there in houre handes, and other men haue our landes and vyneyardes.
Neh.5.6	And when I heard their complaynte and soch wordes, it displeased me sore,
Neh.5.7	and I aduised so in my mynde, that I rebuked the councelers, and the rulers, and sayde vnto them: Euery one of you is to chargeable vnto hys brother. And I brought a greate congregacyon agaynst them,
Neh.5.8	and sayd vnto them we (after oure abilite) haue bought our brethren the Iewes, which were solde vnto the heathen. And wyll ye sell your brethren agayne vnto the heathen, after that they haue bene solde vnto vs? Then helde they theyr peace, and coulde fynde nothynge to answere.
Neh.5.9	And Nehemia sayde: It is not good that ye do. Ought ye not to walke in the feare of God, because of the rebuke of the heathen that are our enemyes?
Neh.5.10	I and my brethren, and my seruauntes do lend them money Ꟶ corne: but as for vsurye, let vs leaue it.
Neh.5.11	Therfore, thys same daye I pray you se that ye restore them theyr landes agayne, theyr vineyardes, oyle gardens, and their houses, and remytte the hundred part of the money, of the corne, wyne and oyle that ye haue wonne of them.
Neh.5.12	Then sayd they: we will restore them agayne, Ꟶ wyll requyre nothing of them, and will do as thou hast spoken. And I called the prestes, Ꟶ toke an oth of them, that they shuld do so.
Neh.5.13	And I shoke my lappe, Ꟶ sayde. God shake out euery man after the same maner from hys house Ꟶ laboure, that maynteyneth not this word: euen thus be he shaken oute, and voyde. And all the congregacyon sayde: Amen, and praysed the Lord. And the people dyd so.
Neh.5.14	And from the tyme forth that (the kyng) committed vnto me to be a captayne of them that were in the land of Iuda, euen from the .xx. yere vnto the .xxxij. yeare of kynge Arthaxerses (that is .xij. yere) I wt my brethren lyued not of soch sustenaunce as was geuen to a captayne.
Neh.5.15	For the olde captaynes that were before me, had bene chargeable vnto the people, and had taken of them bread and wyne, and .xl. sycles of syluer: yee, and their seruauntes had oppressed the people. But so dyd not I, and that because of the feare of God.
Neh.5.16	But I laboured also in the worcke vpon the wal, and bought no lande. And all my seruauntes came thyther together vnto the worke.
Neh.5.17	More ouer, there were at my table an .C. and .l. of the Iewes and rulers, which came vnto me from among the heathen, that are about vs.
Neh.5.18	And ther was prepared for me dayly an oxe and .vj. chosen shep, and byrdes, Ꟶ euer once in .x. dayes a greate summe of wyne. Yet requyred not I the lyuyinge of a captayne, for the bondage was greuous vnto the people.
Neh.5.19	Thincke vpon me my God vnto the best, according to all that I haue done for thys people.
Neh.6.1	And when Sanabalat, Tobiah, Ꟶ Gesem the Arabian, and the other of our enemyes heard that I had buylded the wall: and that ther were no mo gappes therin (howbeit at the same tyme had I not hanged the dores vpon the gates)
Neh.6.2	Sanabalat Ꟶ Gesem sent vnto me, sayenge: that we maye mete and take councell together in the villages that are in the playne of the cytie Ono. Neuerthelesse, they thought to do me euell.
Neh.6.3	And I sent messengers vnto them, sayenge: I haue a great busynes to do, and I cannot come downe. The worcke shulde stande stil, yf I were neclygent, and came downe to you.
Neh.6.4	Howbeit, they sent vnto me as good as foure times after the same maner. And I gaue them the same answere.
Neh.6.5	Then sent Sanabalat hys seruaunt agayne vnto me the fyfth tyme, wt an open letter in hys hand,
Neh.6.6	wherin was writen: it is tolde the heathen, and Gesem hath sayde it, that thou and the Iewes thincke to rebell: for the which cause thou buyldest the wall, that thou mayest be their kyng in these matters,
Neh.6.7	and hast ordeyned the prophetes to preach of the at Ierusalem, and to saye: He is kynge of Iuda. And now shall thys come to the kynges eares: come now therfore, and let vs take our councell together.
Neh.6.8	And I sent vnto hym, sayinge: there is no soch thynges done as thou sayst: for thou faynest them out of thyne awne herte.
Neh.6.9	For they were all mynded to make vs afrayed, sayinge: they shall withdrawe their handes from the worcke, that it shall not be fynisshed. Howbeit, I strengthed my hande the more.
Neh.6.10	And I came vnto the house of Semaia the sonne of Delaia the sonne of Mehetabeel, and he had shut hym self within, and sayde: let vs come together into the house of God, euen vnto the myddes of the temple, and shutte the dores of the temple: for they wyll come to slaye the, yee, euen in the nyght wyll they come to put the to death.
Neh.6.11	And I sayde: shulde any soch man as I flye? Who is that, beyng as I am, that wil go into the temple, to saue his lyfe? I wyll not go in.
Neh.6.12	And I perceaued, that God had not sent hym. Yet spake he prophecy vpon me, neuerthelesse, Tobiah and Sanabalat had hyred him for money.
Neh.6.13	Therfore toke he the money that through feare I shulde so do, and synne: that they might haue an euell reporte of me, to blaspheme me.
Neh.6.14	My God, thinke thou vpon Tobiah and Sanabalat accordynge vnto these theyr workes, and of the prophet Noadia, and of the other prophetes, that wolde haue put me in feare.
Neh.6.15	And the wall was fynysshed on the fyue and twentye daye of the moneth Elul, in two and fyfty dayes.
Neh.6.16	And when all our enemyes hearde therof, all the heathen that were about vs, were afrayed, and theyr courage fayled them. And they perceaued, that thys worcke came of our God.
Neh.6.17	And at the same tyme were ther many of the chefe of Iuda, whose letters wente vnto Tobiah, and agayne from Tobiah vnto them
Neh.6.18	(for there were many in Iuda, that were sworne vnto him: for he was the sonne in lawe of Sechania, the sonne of Arah, Ꟶ his sonne Iehonathan had the daughter of Mesullam, the sonne of Barachia,
Neh.6.19	and they spake good of hym before me, and tolde hym my wordes) and Tobiah sent letters, to put me in feare.
Neh.7.1	Now when the wall was buylded, I hanged on the dores also, and the porters, syngers Ꟶ leuites were appoynted.
Neh.7.2	And I commaunded my brother Hanani, and Hanania the ruler of the castel at Ierusalem: for he was a faithfull man, and feared God more then dyd many other,
Neh.7.3	and I sayde vnto them let not the gates of Ierusalem be opened, vntyll the sonne be whote. And whyle they were standinge in the watch, they shutt the dores and barred them. And we appoynted certayne cytesins of Ierusalem, appoynted to be watchmen, euery one to kepe hys watch, and euery one to be ouer against his house.
Neh.7.4	As for the cite, it was large of rowme, and great, but the people were fewe therin, and the houses were not buylded.
Neh.7.5	And my God gaue me in my hert, that I gathered togeather the principall men, Ꟶ the officiers, and the people, to nombre them, and I founde a register of the nombre of them which came vp before out of the captiuyte:
Neh.7.6	Ꟶ founde wryten therin: these are the sonnes of the land that wente vp from the captiuyte of the caryinge awaye (whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had brought awaye) Ꟶ came agayne to Ierusalem Ꟶ Iuda, euery one vnto his cytie.
Neh.7.7	They which came wt zorobabel are these: Iesua, Nehemia, Asariah, Raamia, Nahamani, Mardochee, Belsam, Mesperath, Beguai, Nahum and Baanah. This is the nombre of the men of the people of Israel.

Neh.9.2	and they that were of the sede of Israel were separated from all the straunge children, Ꟶ stode Ꟶ knowleged theyr synnes, Ꟶ the wyckednesses of theyr fathers,

Neh.9.6	Thou art Lord alone. Thou hast made heauen, Ꟶ the heauen of all heauens, with all theyr hoost, the earth Ꟶ all thinges that are therin, the see Ꟶ all that is therin: Ꟶ thou preseruest them all, and the hoost of heauen worshippeth the.
Neh.9.7	Thou art the Lord God, that hast chosen Abram, Ꟶ broughtest hym out of Ur in Chaldea, and calledst him Abraham,
Neh.9.8	and foundest hys hert faythfull before the and madest a couenaunt wyth him, to geue vnto hys sede the lande of the Cananites, Hethites, Amorites, Pheresites, Iebusites and Gersites, and hast made good thy wordes: for thou art ryghteous
Neh.9.9	and hast consydered the mysery of oure fathers in Egypte, and hearde their complaynte by the reed see,
Neh.9.10	and shewed tokens Ꟶ wonders vpon Pharao, and on all hys seruauntes, and on all the people of hys lande: for thou knewest, that they were presumptuous and cruell agaynst them, and so madest thou the a name, as it is thys daye.
Neh.9.11	And the reed see dydest thou deuyde in sunder before them, so that they went thorow the myddes of the see drye shode: and theyr persecuters threwest thou into the depe (as a stone) in the myghtie waters,
Neh.9.12	Ꟶ leddest them on the daye tyme in a cloudy pyller, Ꟶ on the nyghte season in a pyller of fyre, to shewe them lyghte in the waye that they wente.
Neh.9.13	Thou camest downe also vpon mount Sinai, Ꟶ spakest vnto them from heauen, and gauest them right iudgmentes, true lawes good commaundementes and statutes,
Neh.9.14	and declaredst vnto them thy holy Saboth, and commaundest them preceptes, ordinaunces, and lawes, by the hand of Moses thy seruaunt:
Neh.9.15	and gauest them bred from heauen when they were hongrye, Ꟶ broughtest forth water for them out of the rock when they were thyrstye: and promysedst them, that they shuld go in, and take possessyon of the land, ouer whych thou haddest lyfte vp thyne hand for to geue them.
Neh.9.16	But they Ꟶ oure fathers were proude and hardnecked, so that they folowed not the commaundementes,
Neh.9.17	and wolde not obeye, nether were myndefull of the wonders that thou dyddest for them: but became obstynate and heady, in so moche, that they turned backe to theyr bondage for theyr disobedyence. And thou my God forgauest, and wast gracyous, mercyfull, pacyent, and of greate goodnesse, and forsokest them not
Neh.9.18	And though they made a moulten calfe (Ꟶ sayde: Thys is thy goddes that brought the out of the land of Egypte) and dyd greate blasphemyes,
Neh.9.19	yet forsokest thou them not in the wyldernes, accordyng to thy greate mercy. And the cloudy pyller departed not from them on the daye tyme to leade them the waye, nether the pyller of fyre in the nyght season, to shewe them lyghte in the waye that they wente.
Neh.9.20	And thou gauest them thy good sprete, to enfourme them, and withheldest not thy Manna from theyr mouth, and gauest them water when they were thyrstye.
Neh.9.21	Fortye yeares longe madest thou prouisyon for them in the wyldernesse, so that they lacked nothynge, their clothes waxed not olde, and their fete swelled not.
Neh.9.22	And thou gauest them kyngedomes and nacyons, Ꟶ partedst them accordynge to their porcions, so that they possessed the lande of Sehon kyng of Hesebon, and the lande of Og the kynge of Basan.
Neh.9.23	And their chyldren multiplyedst thou as the starres of heauen, and broughtest them into the lande, wherof thou haddest spoken vnto theyr fathers, that they shulde go into it, and haue it in possessyon.
Neh.9.24	And the chyldren went in, and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabyter of the lande, euen the Cananites, and gauest them into theyr hande, with their kynges and the people of the lande, that they might do with them what they wolde.
Neh.9.25	And they wanne theyr stronge cyties, and a fat lande, and toke possessyon of houses that were full of all maner of goodes, welles digged out, vineyardes, oylegardens, and many frutefull trees: and they dyd eate, Ꟶ were fylled, and became fat, and lyued in welth thorow thy greate goodnes.
Neh.9.26	Neuertheles they were disobedient, Ꟶ rebelled agaynst the, and cast thy lawe behynde their backes, and slewe thy prophetes (which exhorted them earnestly, that they myght bring them agayne vnto the) Ꟶ dyd greate blasphemyes.
Neh.9.27	Therfore, thou gauest them ouer into the hand of their enemyes, that vexed them. And in the tyme of their trouble whan they cryed vnto the, thou hardest them from heauen: Ꟶ thorow thy greate mercy thou gauest them sauiours, whych helped them out of the hande of their enemyes.
Neh.9.28	But when they came to rest, they turned back agayne, to do euell before the: therfore leftest thou them in the hande of theyr enemyes, so that they had the dominyon ouer them. And whan they conuerted, and cryed vnto the, thou herdeft them from heauen, Ꟶ many tymes hast thou delyuered them accordyng to thy greate mercy,
Neh.9.29	Ꟶ testyfyedst vnto them, that thou myghtest bryng them agayne vnto thy lawe. Not withstandyng, they were proude, Ꟶ herkened not vnto thy commaundementes, but synned in thy lawes (whych yf a man do he shall lyue in them,) and turned the shoulder awaye, and were styffnecked, and wolde not heare.
Neh.9.30	And many yeares dyddest thou forbeare them, Ꟶ testifyedst vnto them thorow thy sprete, euen by the hande of thy prophetes, and yet wolde they not heare. Therfore gauest thou them into the hande of the nacions in the landes.
Neh.9.31	And for thy great mercyes sake thou hast not vtterly consumed them, nether forsaken them: for thou art a gracyous and mercyfull God.
Neh.9.32	Now therfore oure God, thou greate God, myghtye and terrible, thou that kepest couenaunt Ꟶ mercy, regarde not a lytle all the trauayle that hath happened vnto vs, and oure kinges, oure princes, our preastes, oure prophetes, Ꟶ our fathers, and all thy people, sence the tyme of the kynges of Assur vnto thys daye.
Neh.9.33	And truly, thou art iust in all that thou hast broughte vpon vs: for thou hast done ryght.
Neh.9.34	As for vs, we haue bene vngodly, Ꟶ oure kynges, Ꟶ oure princes, oure preastes, Ꟶ oure fathers haue not done after thy lawe, nor regarded thy commaundementes, Ꟶ thy earnest exhortacyons, wherwith thou hast exhorted them,

Neh.9.36	Beholde, we are in bondage this daye: Ꟶ so is the lande that thou gauest vnto oure fathers, to enioye the frutes Ꟶ goodes therof, beholde, there are we bondmen.
Neh.9.37	And greate is the increase of it vnto the kynges, whom thou hast set ouer vs, because of oure synnes, Ꟶ they haue domynion ouer oure bodyes and catell (euen as they will them selues,) and we are in great trouble.

Neh.12.26	These were in the dayes of Ioiakim the sonne of Iesua the sonne of Iosedec, and in the dayes of Nehemia the captayne, and of the preaste Esdras the scrybe.
Neh.12.27	And in the dedycacyon of the wall at Ierusalem, they sought the Leuites out of all theyr places, that they myghte be brought to Ierusalem, to kepe the dedicacion Ꟶ gladnesse, wyth thankesgeuynges, and singinge wyth Cymbales, Psalteries, and harpes.
Neh.12.28	And the chyldren of the syngers geathered them selues together from euery syde out of the playne countre aboute Ierusalem, and from the vyllages of Netho phathi,
Neh.12.29	from the house of Gilgal, and out of the countrees of Geba and Asmaueth: for the syngers had buylded them vyllages rounde aboute Ierusalem.
Neh.12.30	And the preastes and Leuites were purifyed, and clensed the people, and the gates and the wall.
Neh.12.31	And I brought the princes of Iuda vp vpon the wall, and appoynted two greate queers of men to geue thankes, whych wente on the ryghte hande of the wall towarde the Donggate,
Neh.12.32	and after them wente Hosaia, and halfe of the prynces of Iuda,
Neh.12.33	and Asaria, Esdras, and Mesullam,
Neh.12.34	Iuda, BenIamin, Semia and Ieremy:
Neh.12.35	and certayne of the preastes chyldren wyth trompettes, namely zachary the sonne of Ionathan, the sonne of Semeia, the sonne of Mathania, the sonne of Michaia, the sonne of zacur, the sonne of Asaph,
Neh.12.36	and hys brethren Semeia, Alarael, Melalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nathanael Ꟶ Iuda and Hanani, wyth the musicall instrumentes of Dauid the man of God. And Esdras the Scrybe went before them,
Neh.12.37	and besyde the wellgate, they wente vp ouer agaynst them vpon the steppes of the cytye of Dauid at the goynge vp of the wall beyonde the house of Dauid, vnto the Watergate Eastwarde.
Neh.12.38	The other queer of them that gaue thankes, went ouer agaynst them, and I after them, and the halfe parte of the people vpon the wall, beyonde the fornacegate, vntyll the brode wall,
Neh.12.39	and beyonde the porte of Ephraim, Ꟶ beyonde the Oldgate, beyonde the fyshgate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Mea, vntyll the Shepegate. And they stode styll in the presongate,
Neh.12.40	and so stode the two queers (of them that gaue thankes) in the house of God, and I and the halfe of the rulers wyth me,
Neh.12.41	and the Preastes, namely Eliakim, Maasia, Miniamin, Michaia, Elioenai, zachary and Hanania, wyth trompettes,
Neh.12.42	and Maasia, Semeiah, Eleasar, Ursi, Iehohanan, Melchiah, Elam and Ser. And the syngers sange loude, hauynge Iestahiah for theyr ouerseer.
Neh.12.43	And the same daye, they offred greate sacrifyces and reioysed: for God had geuen them greate gladnesse, so that both the wyues and chyldren were ioyfull, and the myrth of Ierusalem was herde farre of.
Neh.12.44	At the same tyme were there men appoynted ouer the treasure houses (wherin were the Heue offerynges, the fyrstlynges Ꟶ the tythes) that they shulde geather them out of the feldes aboute the cytyes, to destribute them vnto the preastes Ꟶ Leuites according to the lawe: for Iuda was glad of the preastes, Ꟶ Leuites, that they stode Ꟶ wayted
Neh.12.45	vpon the office of their God, which is a pure office. And the singers Ꟶ porters stode after the commaundment of Dauid Ꟶ of Salomon his sonne:
Neh.12.46	for in the tyme of Dauid Ꟶ Asaph, were the chefe syngers founded, Ꟶ the songes of prayse Ꟶ thankesgeuyng vnto God.
Neh.12.47	In the tyme of zorobabel Ꟶ Nehemia, dyd all they of Israel, geue porcions vnto the syngers and porters, euery daye hys porcion, and they gaue tythes vnto the Leuites: and the Leuites gaue tythes agayne, vnto the children of Aaron.
Neh.13.1	And that daye dyd they reade in the boke of Moses, Ꟶ the people herkened therto, Ꟶ there was found writen therin, that the Ammonites Ꟶ Moabites shulde neuer come into the congregacion of God,
Neh.13.2	because they mett not the children of Israel wt bread and water, but hyred Balaam agaynst them, that he shuld curse them: and oure God turned the curse into a blessing.
Neh.13.3	Now when they herde the lawe, it fortuned, that they separated from Israell euery one that had myxte hym selfe therin
Neh.13.4	And before this had the preast Eliasib the ouer syght of the treasury of the house of oure God, Ꟶ he was kynsman vnto Tobia:
Neh.13.5	Ꟶ had made him a great chambre, Ꟶ there had they afore tyme layed the offeringes, frankencense, vessell, Ꟶ the tythes of corne, and wyne and oyle (accordyng to the commaundement geuen to the Leuites, syngers and porters) and the heueofferynges of the preastes:
Neh.13.6	But in all this tyme was not I at Ierusalem: for in the two Ꟶ thyrtie yeare of Artaxerses kyng of Babylon, came I vnto the kyng, and after certayne dayes optayned I lycence of the kyng
Neh.13.7	to come to Ierusalem. And I gat knowlege of the euell that Eliasib dyd vnto Tobia, in that he had made him a chambre in the court of the house of God,
Neh.13.8	and it greued me sore, Ꟶ I cast forth all the vessels of the house of Tobia out of the chambre,
Neh.13.9	and commaunded them to clense the chambres. And thither brought I agayne the vessels of the house of God, with the meatoffering, and the incense.
Neh.13.10	And I perceaued, that the porcions of the Leuites were not geuen them, and that euery one fled to his land, euen the Leuites and syngers that executed the worke.
Neh.13.11	Then reproued I the rulers, Ꟶ sayd? why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, Ꟶ set them in their place.
Neh.13.12	Then brought all Iuda the tythes of corne, Ꟶ wyne and oyle vnto the treasure.
Neh.13.13	And I made treasurers ouer the treasure, euen Selemiah the preast, Ꟶ zadoc the scrybe, and of the Leuites, Phadaia, Ꟶ vnder their hand was Hanan the sonne of zacur the sonne of Mathania: for they were counted faythfull, and their office was to distribute the porcions vnto their brethren.
Neh.13.14	Thyncke vpon me O my God here in, and wipe not out my mercy that I haue shewed on the house of my God, and on the offices therof.
Neh.13.15	At the same tyme sawe I some tredynge wyne presses on the Saboth, Ꟶ bryngyng in shefes, Ꟶ asses laden wt wyne, grapes, figges Ꟶ brynging all maner of burthens vnto Ierusalem, vpon the Sabaoth daye. And I rebuked them earnestly the same daye that they sold the vitayles.
Neh.13.16	There dwelt men of Tyre also therin, which brought fysh and all maner of ware, Ꟶ solde on the Saboth vnto the children of Iuda in Ierusalem.
Neh.13.17	Then reproued I the rulers in Iuda, Ꟶ sayde vnto them: what euell thyng is this that ye do, Ꟶ breake the Saboth daye?
Neh.13.18	Dyd not youre fathers euen thus, Ꟶ our God brought all thys plage vpon vs Ꟶ vpon this cytie? And ye make the wrath more yet vpon Israel, in that ye breake the Saboth.
Neh.13.19	And it fortuned, that when the portes of Ierusalem beganne to be darke in the euenyng before the Saboth, I commaunded to shutt the gates, and charged, that they shuld not be opened tyll after the Saboth Ꟶ some of my seruauntes set I at the gates, that there shulde no burthen be brought in on the Saboth daye.
Neh.13.20	Then remayned the chapmen Ꟶ marchauntes once or twyce ouer nyght without Ierusalem wyth all maner of wares.
Neh.13.21	Then reproued I them sore, and sayde vnto them: why tary ye all nyght about the wall? If ye do it once agayne, I wyll laye handes vpon you. From that tyme forth came they nomore on the Saboth.
Neh.13.22	And I sayde vnto the Leuites that they shulde clense them selues, and that they shulde come and kepe the gates, to halowe the Saboth daye. Thynke vpon me (O my God) concernyng this also, Ꟶ spare me, accordyng to thy great mercy.
Neh.13.23	And at the same tyme sawe I Iewes, that maried wyues of Asdod, of Ammon and of Moab,
Neh.13.24	Ꟶ their childen spake halfe in the speach of Asdod, Ꟶ coulde not speake in the Iewes language, but by the tong myght a man perceaue euery people.
Neh.13.25	Then I reproued them, Ꟶ cursed them, Ꟶ smote certayne men of them, Ꟶ made them bare, and toke an ooth of them by God: Ye shal not geue your daughters vnto their sonnes, nether shall ye take their daughters vnto youre sonnes, or for youre selues.
Neh.13.26	Dyd not Salomon the kyng of Israel synne for soch? and yet among many Heythen was there no kynge lyke him, whych was deare vnto his God, Ꟶ God made him kynge ouer all Israel, Ꟶ yet neuertheles, outlandysh wemen caused him to synne?
Neh.13.27	Shall we then obeye vnto you, to do all this great euell, Ꟶ to transgresse agaynst oure God, and marye straunge wyues?
Neh.13.28	And one of the children of Iehoiada the sonne of Eliasib the hye preast, had made a contracte with Sanabalat the Horonite: but I chaced him from me.
Neh.13.29	(O my God) thynke thou vpon them that defyle the presthode, Ꟶ the couenaunt of the presthode Ꟶ of the Leuites.
Neh.13.30	Thus clensed I them from all soch as were outlandish, and appoynted the courses of the preastes Ꟶ Leuites, euery one in his office,
Neh.13.31	Ꟶ to offre the wod at tymes appoynted, and the fyrst frutes. Thinke thou vpon me (O my God) for the best.
