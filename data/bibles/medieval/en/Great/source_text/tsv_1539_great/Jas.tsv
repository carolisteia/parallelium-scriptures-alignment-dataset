Jas.0.0	¶ The Epistle of Saynct Iames.
Jas.1.1	Iames the seruaunt of God Ꟶ of the Lorde Iesus Christ, sendeth gretyng to the twelue trybes which are scattered abroade.
Jas.1.2	My brethren, count it for an excedyng ioye, when ye fall into diuers temptacyons:
Jas.1.3	knowyng this, that the trying of your fayth gendreth pacience:
Jas.1.4	and let pacience haue her parfect worke, that ye maye be parfecte and sounde, lackyng nothyng.
Jas.1.5	If eny of you lacke wysdome, let hym aske of him that geueth it: euen God, which geueth to all men indifferentlye, and casteth no man in the teeth: and it shalbe geuen him.
Jas.1.6	But let him aske in fayth, and wauer not, For he that douteth, is lyke a waue of the see, which is tost of the wyndes and caryed with violence.
Jas.1.7	Nether let that man thinke, that he shall receaue eny thing of the Lorde.
Jas.1.8	A wauerynng mynded man, is vnstable in all his wayes.
Jas.1.9	Let the brother which is of lowe degre reioyce whan he is exalted.
Jas.1.10	Agayne: let hym that is riche, reioyce whan he is made lowe. For euen as the flower of the grasse, shall he passe awaye.
Jas.1.11	For as the sonne ryseth with heat, Ꟶ the grasse wydereth, Ꟶ hys flower falleth awaye, and the beautie of the fassyon of it perissheth: euen so shall the rich man perisshe in his wayes.
Jas.1.12	Happy is the man that endureth temptacyon: for when he is tryed, he shall receaue the crowne of lyfe, which the Lorde hath promysed to them that loue hym.
Jas.1.13	Let no man saye when he is tempted, that he is tempted of God, for as God can not be tempted with euill, so nether he hymselfe tempt the eny man.
Jas.1.14	But euery man is tempted, whan he is drawne awaye, Ꟶ entysed of hys awne concupiscence.
Jas.1.15	Then, when lust hath conceaued, she bryngeth forth synne: Ꟶ synne when it is finisshed, bryngeth forth deeth.
Jas.1.16	Do not erre my deare brethren,
Jas.1.17	Euery good gyfte, and euery parfayt gyft, is from aboue, and commeth downe from the father of lyghtes wt whome is no variablenes, nether is he chaunged vnto darcknes.
Jas.1.18	Of hys awne wyll begat he vs with the worde of trueth, that we shulde be the fyrst frutes of hys creatures.
Jas.1.19	Wherfore (deare brethren) let euery man be swyfte to heare, slowe to speake, slowe to wrath.
Jas.1.20	For the wrath of man worketh not that which is ryghteous before God.
Jas.1.21	Wherfore laye a parte all fylthynes Ꟶ superfluyte of maliciousnes, and receaue wt meknes, the worde that is graffed in you, which is able to saue your soules.
Jas.1.22	And se that ye be doars of the worde Ꟶ not hearers onely, deceauing your awne selues.
Jas.1.23	For yf eny man heare the worde and declareth not the same by his workes, he is lyke vnto a man beholding his bodely face in a glasse.
Jas.1.24	For assone as he hath loked on hym selfe, he goeth his waye, Ꟶ forgetteth immediatly what hys fassyon was.
Jas.1.25	But who so loketh in the parfayt lawe of libertye, and contynueth therin (yf he be not a forget full hearer, but a doar of the worke) the same shalbe happye in his dede.
Jas.1.26	If eny man among you seme to be deuoute Ꟶ, refrayneth not hys tong, but deceaueth hys awne hert, thys mannes deuocyon is in vayne.
Jas.1.27	Pure deuocyon and vndefyled before God the father, is this: to visyt the fatherlesse Ꟶ widdowes in theyr aduersyte, Ꟶ to kepe him selfe vnspotted of the worlde.
Jas.2.1	My brethren, esteme not the fayth of our Lorde Iesus Christ the Lorde of glory wt respecte of persons.
Jas.2.2	For if ther come into youre company a man wearyng a golden ryng, clothed in goodly aparell, and ther come in also a poore man in vyle rayment,
Jas.2.3	Ꟶ ye haue a respecte to him that weareth the gaye clothing, and say vnto him: Syt thou here in a good place: and saye vnto the poore: stande thou there, or syt here vnder my fote stole:
Jas.2.4	are ye not parciall in youre selues, and haue iudged after euyll thoughtes?
Jas.2.5	Harken my deare beloued brethren. Hath not God chosen the poore of thys worlde, soch as are ryche in faythe, Ꟶ heyres of the kyngdome, whych he promysed to them that loue hym?
Jas.2.6	But ye haue despysed the poore. Do not rych men execute tyrannye vpon you, and draw you before the iudgement seates.
Jas.2.7	Do not they speake euyll of that good name which is called vpon ouer you?
Jas.2.8	Yf ye fulfyll the royall lawe, accordynge to the scripture. (Thou shalte loue thyne neghboure as thy selfe) ye do well.
Jas.2.9	But yf ye regarde one person more then another, ye commyt synne, Ꟶ are rebuked of the lawe, as transgressours.
Jas.2.10	Whosoeuer shall kepe the whole lawe, Ꟶ yet fayle in one poynt, he is gyltie of all.
Jas.2.11	For he that sayd: Thou shalt not commyt adulterye, sayde also thou shalt not kyll. Though thou do none adulterye, yet yf thou kyll, thou art become a transgressor of the lawe.
Jas.2.12	So speake ye, and so do, as they that shalbe iudged by the lawe of libertye.
Jas.2.13	For he shal haue iudgement without mercy that sheweth no mercy: and mercy reioyseth agaynst iudgement.
Jas.2.14	What auayleth it my brethren, though a man saye he hath fayth, yf he haue no dedes? Can fayth saue hi
Jas.2.15	If a brother or a syster be naked Ꟶ destitute of dayly fode,
Jas.2.16	Ꟶ one of you saye vnto them: departe in peace, God send you warmnes Ꟶ fode, not wtstandyng ye geue them not those thinges which are nedful to the body, what shal it helpe?
Jas.2.17	Euen so fayth, yf it haue no dedes: is deed in it selfe:
Jas.2.18	But some man wyll saye: thou hast fayth, Ꟶ I haue dedes: shewe me thy fayth by thy dedes: Ꟶ I will shewe the my fayth by my dedes.
Jas.2.19	Beleuest thou that ther is one god? Thou doest well. The deuyls also beleue, Ꟶ tremble.
Jas.2.20	But wilt thou vnderstande. (O thou vayne man) the fayth without dedes is deed?
Jas.2.21	Was not Abraham oure father iustifyed thorow workes, when he had offered Isaac his sonne vpon the aulter?
Jas.2.22	Thou seest, how that fayth wrought wt his dedes, Ꟶ through the dedes was the fayth made parfecte:
Jas.2.23	Ꟶ the scripture was fulfylled, which sayth: Abraham beleued God, and it was reputed vnto hym for ryghtewesnes: Ꟶ he was called the frende of God.
Jas.2.24	Ye se then how that of dedes a man is iustifyed, and not of fayth onely.
Jas.2.25	Lykewyse also, was not Raab the harlot iustifyed thorow workes, when she had receaued the messengers, and had sent them out another waye?
Jas.2.26	For as the body, wythout the sprete is deed, euen so fayth wythout workes is deed also.
Jas.3.1	My brethren, be not euery man a master, knowinge how that we shal receaue the greater damnacion:
Jas.3.2	for in many thinges we synne all. If a man synne not in worde, the same is a perfecte man, Ꟶ able also to tame all the body.
Jas.3.3	Beholde, we put bittes in to the horses mouthes, that they maye obeye vs, Ꟶ we turne aboute all the body of them.
Jas.3.4	Beholde also the shyppes, whych though they be so great, Ꟶ are dryuen of fearce wyndes, yet are they turned about wyth a very small helme whyther soeuer the violence of the gouerner will.
Jas.3.5	Euen so the tonge is a lytel member also, and boasteth great thynges. Beholde, how gret a thynge a lytell fyre kyndleth,
Jas.3.6	and the tonge is fyre, euen a world of wyckednes. So is the tonge set amonge oure membres, that it defyleth the whole body, and setteth a fyre all that we haue of nature, and is it selfe set a fyre euen of hell.
Jas.3.7	All the natures of beastes, and of byrdes, and of serpentes, Ꟶ thinges of the see are meked and tamed of the nature of man.
Jas.3.8	But the tonge can no man tame. It is an vnruely euyll, full of deedly poyson.
Jas.3.9	Ther wt blesse we God the father, and therwith cursse wemen, which are made after the symilitude of God.
Jas.3.10	Out of one mouth proceadeth blessing and cursyng. My brethren, these thinges ought not so to be.
Jas.3.11	Doth a fountayne send forth at one place swete water and bytter also.
Jas.3.12	Can the fygge tree (my brethren) beare olyue beries: ether a a vyne beare fygges?
Jas.3.13	So can no fountayne geue bothe salt water Ꟶ fresshe also. Yf eny man be wyse Ꟶ endued wt knowledge amonge you, let hym shewe his workes out of good conuersacion with mekenes of wysdome.
Jas.3.14	But yf ye haue bytter enuyeng Ꟶ stryfe in your herte, reioyce not: nether be lyars agaynst the trueth:
Jas.3.15	For soch wysdome descendeth not from aboue: but is erthy, naturall, Ꟶ diuelisshe.
Jas.3.16	For wher enuyeng Ꟶ strife is, there is vnstablenes, Ꟶ all manner of euyll workes.
Jas.3.17	But the wysdome that is from aboue, is first pure, then peasable, gentle, Ꟶ easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good frutes, without iudging, without simulacion:
Jas.3.18	yee, Ꟶ the frute of ryghtewesnes is sowen in peace, of them that mayntene peace.
Jas.4.1	From whence commeth warre, and fyghtyng amonge you? come they not here hence? euen of youre lustes, that fight in your membres?
Jas.4.2	Ye lust, and haue not. Ye enuye Ꟶ haue indignacyon, Ꟶ can not obtayne. Ye fight Ꟶ warre. Ye haue not because ye aske not.
Jas.4.3	Ye aske and receaue not, because ye aske amysse: euen to consume it vpon your lustes.
Jas.4.4	Ye aduouterars, and wemen that breke matrimonye: knowe ye not how that the frendshyp of the worlde is enmytie wt God? whosoeuer therfore wilbe a frende of the worlde, is made the enemye of God.
Jas.4.5	Ether do ye thynke that the scripture sayth in vayne. The sprete the dwelleth in vs, lusteth euen contrary to enuy:
Jas.4.6	but geueth more grace.
Jas.4.7	Submit your selues therfore to God: but resyst the deuyll, and he will flye from you.
Jas.4.8	Drawe nye to God, and he will drawe nye to you. Clense your handes ye siners, Ꟶ pourge your hertes ye waueryng mynded.
Jas.4.9	Suffre afflictions Ꟶ mourne, Ꟶ wepe. Let your laughter be turned to mournyng, Ꟶ youre ioye to heuynes.
Jas.4.10	Humble youre selues in the sight of the lord, Ꟶ he shal lyft you vp.
Jas.4.11	Backbyte not one another, brethren. He that backbyteth his brother, Ꟶ he that iudgeth hys brother, backbyteth the lawe, and iudgeth the lawe. But Ꟶ yf thou iudge the lawe, thou art not an obseruer of the lawe: but a iudge.
Jas.4.12	Ther is one lawe geuer which is able to saue and to destroye. What art thou that iudgest another?
Jas.4.13	Go to now ye that saye: to daye and to morow let vs go into soch a citye, and continue there a yeare, and bye and sell, and wynne:
Jas.4.14	Ꟶ yet can not ye tell, what shall happen on the morow. For what thing is your lyfe? It is euen a vapour, that apereth for a lytell time, and then vanissheth awaye:
Jas.4.15	For that ye ought to saye: yf the Lord will, and yf we lyue, let vs do this or that.
Jas.4.16	But now ye reioyce in your boastynges. All soch reioysynge is euyll.
Jas.4.17	Therfore to hym that knoweth how to do good, and doth it not, to hym it is synne.
Jas.5.1	Go to now ye ryche men. Wepe, and howle on your wretchednes that shal come vpon you.
Jas.5.2	Your riches is corrupte, your garmentes are motheaten,
Jas.5.3	Youre golde Ꟶ syluer is cankred, and the rust of the shalbe a wytnes vnto you, Ꟶ shall eate youre flesshe as it were fyre. Ye haue heaped treasure together in your last dayes:
Jas.5.4	Beholde the hyre of labourers which haue reaped downe youre feldes (which hyre is of you kept backe by fraude) cryeth: Ꟶ the cryes of them which haue reaped, are entred in to the eares of the Lord Sabaoth.
Jas.5.5	Ye haue lyued in pleasure on the erthe, Ꟶ bene wantan. Ye haue norysshed youre hertes, as in a daye of slaughter.
Jas.5.6	Ye haue condempned and kylled the iust, and he hath not resisted you.
Jas.5.7	Be pacient therfore brethren, vnto the commynge of the Lord. Beholde, the husbande man wayteth for the precyous frute of the earth, Ꟶ hath longe pacience ther vpon, vntyll he receaue the early Ꟶ the latter rayne.
Jas.5.8	Be ye also pacient therfore, and settle youre hertes, for the commynge of the Lorde draweth nye.
Jas.5.9	Grudge not one agaynst another brethren lest ye be damned. Beholde, the iudge standeth before the dore.
Jas.5.10	Take (my brethren) the Prophetes for an ensample of sufferinge aduersytie, and of pacience, which spake in the name of the Lorde.
Jas.5.11	Beholde, we counte them happy which endure. Ye haue heard of the pacience of Iob, and haue knowen what ende the Lorde made. For the Lord is very pitiefull and mercyfull.
Jas.5.12	But aboue all thynges my brethren sweare not, nether by heuen, nether by earth, nether eny other othe. Let your yee be yee, and your naye naye: lest ye fall into ypocrisy,
Jas.5.13	If any of you be vexed, let him praye. If eny of you be mery, let him synge Psalmes.
Jas.5.14	If eny be diseased amonge you, let hym call for the elders of the congregacyon, and let them praye ouer him, Ꟶ anoynte him with oyle in the name of the Lorde,
Jas.5.15	and the prayer of fayth shall saue the sycke, and the Lord shal rayse him vp: and yf he haue commytted synnes, they shalbe forgeuen hym.
Jas.5.16	Knowledge youre fautes one to another: and praye one for another, that ye maye be healed. For the feruent prayer of a ryghteous man auayleth moch.
Jas.5.17	Helyas was a man vnder infirmitees euen as we are, and he prayed in his prayer that it myght not rayne: and it rayned not on the earthe by the space of thre yeares Ꟶ syxe monethes.
Jas.5.18	And he prayed agayne, and the heauen gaue rayne, and the earth brought forth her frute.
Jas.5.19	Brethren, yf eny of you do erre from the trueth and another conuert hym,
Jas.5.20	let the same knowe that he which conuerteth the synner from goyng a straye out of hys waye, shall saue a soule from deeth, and shal hyde the multitude of synnes.
