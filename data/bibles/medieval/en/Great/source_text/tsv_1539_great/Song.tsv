Song.3.5	I charge you, O ye daughters of Ierusalem, by the Roes and Hyndes of the felde, that ye wake not vp my loue ner touche her, tyll she be content herselfe.
Song.3.6	Who is thys, that commeth vp out of the wyldernesse like vapours of smoke, as it were a smell of Myrre, franckencense, and all maner spyces of the Apotecary?
Song.3.7	Beholde, aboute Salomons bedstede ther stande .lx. valeaunt men of the most myghtie in Israel.

Song.3.11	Go forth (O ye daughters of Syon) and beholde Kynge Salomon in the crowne: wherwith his mother crowned him in the daye of hys mariage, and in the daye of the gladnesse of his hert.
Song.4.1	O How fayre art thou, my loue, howe fayre art thou? thou hast doues eyes, besyde that which lyeth hyd within.
Song.4.2	Thy hearye lockes are like the woll of a flocke of gotes that be shorne vpon mount Gilead: Thy teth are like shepe of the same bignesse, which went vp from the washinge place: where euery one beareth two twyns, and not one vnfrutefull amonge them.
Song.4.3	Thy lippes are like a rose coloured rybonde, thy wordes are louely, thy chekes are like a pece of a pomgranat within thyne heares.
Song.4.4	Thy neck is lyke the tower of Dauid builded with costly stones lyinge out on the sides wher vpon there hang a thousande shyldes, yee all the weapens of the geauntes.
Song.4.5	Thy two brestes are lyke two twyns of younge roes, which fede amonge roses.

Song.5.3	I haue put of my cote, how can I do it on agayne? I haue washed my fete, how shall I fyle them agayne?
Song.5.4	My loue put in his hand at the hole, and my herte was moued within me.
Song.5.5	I stode vp to open vnto my beloued, Ꟶ my handes dropped with Myrre, Ꟶ the Myrre ranne downe my fyngers vpon the locke.
Song.5.6	I opened vnto my beloued, but he was departed and gone his waye. Now when he spake, my hert was gone: I sought hym, but I coulde not fynde hym: I cryed vpon him, neuerthelesse, he gaue me no answere.
Song.5.7	So the watchmen that wente about the cytie, founde me, smote me, Ꟶ wounded me: Yee, they that kepte the walles, toke awaye my kercheafe fro me.
Song.5.8	I charge you therfore, O ye daughters of Ierusalem, yf ye fynde my beloued, that ye tell hym, how that I am syck for loue.
Song.5.9	What maner of man is thy loue aboue other louers? O thou fayrest amonge wemen? Or what can thy loue do, more then other louers, that thou chargest vs so straytely?

Song.5.16	The wordes of his mouthe are swete, yee, he is altogether louely. Soche one is my loue. O ye daughters of Ierusalem, soch one is my loue.
Song.6.1	Whither is thy loue gone then (O thou fayrest amonge wemen) whither is is thy loue departed? we will seke him with the:
Song.6.2	My loue is gone downe into hys garden, vnto the swete smellyng beddes, that he may refresh hym self in the garden, and gather roses.
Song.6.3	My loue is myne Ꟶ I am his, which fedeth amonge the roses.
Song.6.4	Thou art beautyfull, o my loue, as is the place of Thirza, thou art fayre as Ierusalem, fearfull as an armye of men, wt theyr banners.

Song.6.8	There are .lx. Quenes .lxxx. wyues, and dameselles without nombre.
Song.6.9	One is my doue, one is my derlynge. She is the onely beloued of her mother, Ꟶ deare vnto her that bare her. When the daughters sawe her, they sayde, she was blessed. Yee the Quenes and wyues praysed her.
Song.6.10	What is she this, that loketh forth as the mornynge? fayre as the moone, cleare as the sunne, and fearful as an armye of men wt their baners.
Song.6.11	I wente downe into the nutt garden, to se what grewe by the brokes, Ꟶ to loke yf the vyneyarde florished, or yf the pomgranates were shot forth.
Song.6.12	I knewe not that my soule had made me the charyote of the people that be vnder tribute.
Song.6.13	Turne againe, turne agayne. O thou perfecte one turne ageyne, turne agayne, Ꟶ we will loke vpon the. What wil ye se in the Sulamyte? She is lyke men of warre singynge in a companye.
Song.7.1	O how pleasaunt are thy treadynges with the shoes, thou princes daughter? Thy thighes are like a fayre iewell, which is wrought by a connyng worcke master.
Song.7.2	Thy nauell is lyke a rounde goblet, which is neuer without drinke. Thy wombe is lyke a hepe of wheat that is sett aboute wt roses
Song.7.3	Thy two brestes are lyke two twyns of yonge roes.
Song.7.4	Thy neck is as it were a tower of yuery: thine eyes also are lyke the water poles that are in Hesebon, besyde the porte of Bathrabbim: thy nose is lyke the tower of Libanus, which loketh toward Damascus.
Song.7.5	That head that standeth vpon the, is lyke Carmel Ꟶ the hearre of thy heade is lyke purple and lyke a kynge goynge forth wt his garde aboute hym.
Song.7.6	O how fayre Ꟶ louely art thou my dearlynge, in pleasures?
Song.7.7	Thy stature is lyke a Palme tree Ꟶ thy brestes lyke the grapes.
Song.7.8	I sayde I will clyme vp into the Palme tree, Ꟶ take holde of his hye braunches. Thy brestes also shalbe as the vyne clustres the smell of thy nostrels lyke is the smell of apples,
Song.7.9	and thy iawes lyke the beste wyne. Whiche goeth strayte vnto my beloued and brusteth forth by the lyppes of the Auncyent eldres.
Song.7.10	There wyl I turne me vnto my loue Ꟶ he shall turne hym vnto me.
Song.7.11	O come on my loue, we will go forth into the felde, Ꟶ take oure lodgynge in the villages.
Song.7.12	In the mornynge wyll we go se the vyneyarde: we will se yf the vyne be spronge forth, yf the grapes be growne, and yf the pomgranates be shot out. There will I geue the my brestes:
Song.7.13	the Mandragoras geue theyr sweate smell: and besyde oure dores are all maner of pleasaunt frutes: both newe, Ꟶ olde: whych I haue kepte for the, o my beloued.
Song.8.1	O that I myght fynde the wythout, and kysse the, whom I loue as my brother whych suckte my mothers brestes: and that thou shalt not be despised
Song.8.2	I will leade the, and brynge the in to my mothers house: that thou myghtest teach me, Ꟶ that I myght geue the drynke of spiced wyne, Ꟶ of the swete sappe of my pongranates.
Song.8.3	His left hande shalbe vnder my head Ꟶ hys ryght hande shall embrace me.
Song.8.4	I charge you, O ye daughters of Ierusalem, that ye wake not vp my loue, ner touch her, tyll she be content her selfe.
Song.8.5	What is she this, that commeth vp from the wildernes, and leaneth vpon her loue? I waked the vp amonge the apple trees, where thy mother conceyued the, where thy mother (I saye) brought the into the worlde.
Song.8.6	O set me as a seale vpon thine herte, and as a seale vpon thyne arme: for loue is myghtie as the death, Ꟶ gelousy as the hel. Her coales are of fyre, Ꟶ a very flamme of the Lorde:
Song.8.7	so that many waters are not able to quenche loue, nether maye the streames droune it. Yee, yf a man wolde geue all the good of his house for loue, he shuld counte it nothyng,
Song.8.8	Our syster is but yonge, Ꟶ hath no brestes: What shall we do for our syster, whan she shall be spoken for?
Song.8.9	Yf she be a wall, we shal buylde a syluer bolwercke ther vpon: yf she be an open dore, we shall fasten her with borders of Cedre tree.
Song.8.10	I am a wall, and my brestes lyke towres, then was I as one that hath founde fauoure in his syght.
Song.8.11	Salomon hath a vyneyarde at Baal Hamon, Ꟶ this vyneyarde delyuered he vnto the kepers: that euery one for the frute therof shulde geue hym a thousande peces of syluer.
Song.8.12	My vyneyard is in my sight: thou (O Salomon) must haue a thousande, and the kepers two hundred with the frute.
Song.8.13	Thou that dwellest in the gardens, O let me heare thy voyce, that my companyons maye herken to the same.
Song.8.14	O get the awaye, my loue, and be as a roo or a yong hert vpon the swete smellynge mountaynes.
