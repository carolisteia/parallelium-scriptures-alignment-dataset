Exod.0.0	¶ The second boke of Moses called in the Hebrue: Ueelleh Schemoth: And in the Latin, Exodus.
Exod.1.1	These are the names of the children of Israel, which came to Egypte wyth Iacob, euery man came wt hys housholde:
Exod.1.2	Ruben, Simeon, Leui, and Iuda,
Exod.1.3	Isachar zabulon, and Beniamin,
Exod.1.4	Dan Nephtali, Gad and Aser.
Exod.1.5	All the soules that came out of the loynes of Iacob were .lxx. But Ioseph was in Egypte allredie.
Exod.1.6	And Ioseph dyed and all hys brethren and all that generacyon,
Exod.1.7	and the chyldren of Israel grewe, encreased, multiplyed, and waxed exceadinge myghtye: and the lande was full of them.
Exod.1.8	But there rose vp a newe kynge in Egypte whych knewe not Ioseph.
Exod.1.9	And he sayde vnto his folke: beholde, the people of the chyldren of Israel are greater and myghtyer than we.
Exod.1.10	Come on, let vs playe wisely wyth them, lest they multiplye, Ꟶ lest it happen, that (yf there chaunce any warre) they ioyne them selues vnto oure enemyes and fyghte agaynst vs, and so gete them out of the lande.
Exod.1.11	Therfore dyd they sette taskmasters ouer them, to kepe them vnder wt burthens. And they bylte vnto Pharao treasure cities: Phiton and Rameses.
Exod.1.12	But the more they vexed them, the moare they multiplyed and grewe, so that they abhorred the chyldren of Israel.
Exod.1.13	And the Egyptians helde the chyldren of Israel in bondage without mercye.
Exod.1.14	Therfore was their lyfe bytter vnto them in that cruell bondage, in claye Ꟶ brycke, and all maner of worke in the feldes. For all their bondage which they serued them, was full of tyrannye.
Exod.1.15	And the kynge of Egypte sayde vnto the mydwiues of the Hebrues women, of which the ones name was Sephora and the other Phua:
Exod.1.16	when ye do the offyce of a mydwife to the women of the Ebrues and se in the byrth tyme that it is a boye, ye shall kyll it. But yf it be a daughter, it shall lyue.
Exod.1.17	Not withstondynge the mydwiues feared God and dyd not as the kynge of Egypte commaunded them: but saued the men chyldren.
Exod.1.18	And the kynge of Egypte called for the mydwiues and sayde vnto them: why haue ye delt on thys maner, and haue saued the menchyldren?
Exod.1.19	And the mydwiues answered Pharao, that the Hebrues wemen are not as the wemen of Egypte: for they are sturdie women, and are delyuered yer the midwyues come at them.
Exod.1.20	And God therfore delt well with the midwyues. And the people multiplyed and waxed very myghtye.
Exod.1.21	And it fortuned because the midwyues feared God, he made them houses.
Exod.1.22	And Pharao charged all hys people, sayinge: All the menchyldren that are borne, cast into the ryuer, and saue the maydechyldren alyue.
Exod.2.1	And ther went a man of the house of Leui. And toke a daughter of Leui.
Exod.2.2	And the wyfe conceaued and bare a sonne. And when she sawe that it was a proper chylde she hyd hym thre monethes.
Exod.2.3	And when she coulde no longer hyde hym, she toke a basket of bulrusshes and dawbed it with slyme and pytche, and layde the chylde therin, and put it in the flagges by the ryuers brynke.
Exod.2.4	And his sister stode a farre of, to wete what wold come of it.
Exod.2.5	And the daughter of Pharao came doune to washe herselfe in the ryuer, and hyr maydens walked alonge by the ryuers syde. And when the sawe the basket amonge the flagges, she sent hyr mayde to fetch it.
Exod.2.6	And when she had opened it, she sawe it was a chylde: and beholde, the babe wepte. And she had compassyon on it, and sayde: it is one of the Hebrues chyldren.
Exod.2.7	Then sayde hys syster vnto Pharaos daughter: shall I go and call vnto the a nurse of the Hebrues wemen, to nurse the, the chylde?
Exod.2.8	Pharaos daughter answered her: Goo. And the mayde ranne and called the chyldes mother.
Exod.2.9	To whom Pharaos daughter sayde: Take thys chylde a waye, and nurse it for me, I wyll rewarde the. And the woman toke the chylde, and nursed it vp.
Exod.2.10	The chylde grewe, Ꟶ she brought it vnto Pharaos daughter, Ꟶ it was made hyr sonne, Ꟶ she called the name of it Moses, because (sayde she) I toke him out of the water.
Exod.2.11	And it happened in those dayes, when Moses was waxed great, that he went out vnto his brethren and loked on their burdens, Ꟶ spied an Egyptian smytynge an Hebrue whych was one of hys brethren.
Exod.2.12	And he loked rounde aboute, and when he sawe no man by, he slewe the Egyptian, and hyd him in the sonde.
Exod.2.13	And whan he was gone out another daye: beholde two Hebrues stroue to gether. And he sayde vnto hym that dyd the wronge: wherfore smytest thou thy felowe?
Exod.2.14	He answered: who made the a man of auctoryte to iudge vs? Speakest thou to kyll me, as thou kylledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared Ꟶ sayde: of a suertie thys thynge is knowne:
Exod.2.15	And Pharao herde of it, and went aboute to slee Moses: And Moses flyenge from the face of Pharao, dwelt in the lande of Midian, and he sat doune by a welles syde.
Exod.2.16	The preast of Midian had .vij. daughters which came and drewe water, and fylled the troughes, for to water their fathers shepe.
Exod.2.17	And the shepardes came Ꟶ droue them awaye: but Moses stode vp and helped them, and watered their shepe:
Exod.2.18	And when they came to Raguel their father, he sayde: howe happeneth it that ye are come so soone to daye?
Exod.2.19	And they answered: a man of Egypte delyuered vs from the hande of the shepardes, and so drewe vs water, Ꟶ watered the shepe.
Exod.2.20	He sayde vnto hys daughters. And wher is he? why haue ye so lefte the man? Call hym that he maye eate bread.
Exod.2.21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man. And he gaue Moses zephora hys daughter,
Exod.2.22	which whan she bare a sonne. called him Gerson: for he sayde: I haue bene a straunger in a straunge lande.
Exod.2.23	And it chaunced in processe of tyme, that the kynge of Egypte dyed, and the chyldren of Israel syghed by the reason of bondage, and cryed.
Exod.2.24	And their complaynt came vp vnto God from the bondage: and God hearde their mone. And God remembred hys promyse with Abraham, Isaac and Iacob.
Exod.2.25	And God loked vpon the chyldren of Israel, and God had respecte vnto them.
Exod.3.1	Moses kepte the shepe of Iethro hys father in lawe, preest of Midian, and he droue the flocke to the backesyde of the desert, and came to the mountayne of God, Horeb.
Exod.3.2	And the angell of the Lorde appeared vnto him in a flame of fyre out of the myddes of a bush. And he loked, Ꟶ beholde, the bush burned wt fyre, and the bush was not consumed.
Exod.3.3	Therfore Moses sayde: I wyll goo nowe, and see thys greate syght, howe it cometh that the bushe burneth not.
Exod.3.4	And when the Lorde sawe that he came for to see, God called vnto him out of the myddes of the bushe, and sayde: Moses, Moses. He answered: here am I.
Exod.3.5	And he sayde: come not hyther, put thy shooes of thy fete: for the place where on thou stondest is holy grounde.
Exod.3.6	And he sayde I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isahac Ꟶ the God of Iacob And Moses hyd his face, for he was afrayed to loke vpon God.
Exod.3.7	And the Lorde sayde: I haue surely sene the trouble of my people whych are in Egypte, and haue herde theyr crye from the face of their taskemasters. For I knowe their sorowes,
Exod.3.8	and am come downe to delyuer them out of the hande of the Egyptians, and to brynge them out of that lande vnto a good lande and a large: and vnto a lande that floweth wyth mylcke and hony: euen vnto the place of the Cananites and Hethites, and Amorites, and Pherezites, and Heuites, and of the Iebusites.
Exod.3.9	Nowe therfore, the complaynt of the chyldren of Israel is come vnto me, and I haue also sene the oppressyon wherwith the Egyptians oppresse them.
Exod.3.10	Come thou therfore, and I wyll sende the vnto Pharao, that thou mayest brynge my people the chyldren of Israel out of Egypte.
Exod.3.11	And Moses sayde vnto God: what am I to goo vnto Pharao, and to brynge the chyldren of Israel out of Egypte?
Exod.3.12	And he answered: I wyll be wyth the. And thys shalbe a token vnto the that I haue sent the: after that thou hast brought the people out of Egypte, ye shall serue God vpon thys mountayne.
Exod.3.13	And Moses sayde vnto God: beholde, when I come vnto the chyldren of Israel, I shall saye vnto them: the God of youre fathers hath sent me vnto you, and yf they saye vnto me, what is hys name, what answere shall I geue them?
Exod.3.14	And God answered Moses: I am that I am: and he sayde: thys shalt thou saye vnto the chyldren of Israel. I am hath sent me vnto you.
Exod.3.15	And God spake further vnto Moses: thus shalt thou saye vnto the chyldren of Israel the Lorde God of youre fathers, the God of Abraham the God of Isahac, and the God of Iacob hath sent me vnto you: thys is my name for euer, and thys is my memoryall into generacyon and generacyon.
Exod.3.16	Goo and gather the elders of Israel to gether, and thou shalt saye vnto them: the Lorde God of youre fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isahac, and the God of Iacob apeared vnto me, and sayde: In visitynge haue I visited you, and knowe that which is done to you in Egypte
Exod.3.17	And I haue sayde, I wyll brynge you out of the tribulacyon of Egypte vnto the lande of the Canauytes, and Hethites, and Amorytes, and Pherezytes, and Heuytes, and Iebusytes: euen vnto a lande that floweth wyth mylcke and hony.
Exod.3.18	And whan they heare thy voyce then goo, both thou and the elders of Israel shall go vnto the kynge of Egypte, and saye vnto him: The Lorde God of the Hebrues hath met wyth vs: and nowe wyll we go therfore .iij. dayes iourney into the wyldernesse, and do sacrifyce vnto the Lorde oure God.
Exod.3.19	And I am sure, that the kynge of Egypte wyll not let you goo, no not in a myghtye hande:
Exod.3.20	and I wyll stretche out myne hande and smyte Egypte wyth all my wonders which I will do in the myddes therof. And after that he wyll let you goo.
Exod.3.21	And I wyll gett thys people fauoure in that syghte of the Egyptians: so that when ye goo, ye shall not goo emptie:
Exod.3.22	but a wyfe shall borow of hir neyghbouresse Ꟶ of her that soieorneth in hir house, iewels of syluer and of Gold and rayment. And ye shall put them on youre sonnes and daughters, Ꟶ shall robbe the Egyptians.
Exod.4.1	Moses answered and sayde: Se, they wyll not beleue me nor herken vnto my voyce: but will saye the Lorde hath not apeared vnto the.
Exod.4.2	And the Lorde sayde vnto him: what is that whych is in thyne hande? he answered a rodd.
Exod.4.3	And he sayde: cast it on the grounde. And he cast it on the grounde, and it became a serpent. And Moses fled from the syght of it.
Exod.4.4	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: put forth thyne hande and take it by the tayle. And therfore he put forth hys hande Ꟶ caught it, and it became a rodd in his hande.
Exod.4.5	For thys thinge (sayeth he) shall they beleue the, that the Lorde God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isahac Ꟶ the God of Iacob hath apeared vnto the.
Exod.4.6	And the Lorde sayde forthermore vnto hym: thrust thyne hande in to thy bosome. And he thrust hys hande in to hys bosome. And whan he toke it out agayne, beholde, his hande was leperous euen as snowe.
Exod.4.7	And he sayde: put thyne hande in to thy bosome agayne. And he put hys hande into his bosome agayne, and plucked it out of hys bosome, Ꟶ beholde, it was turned agayne as hys other flesshe.
Exod.4.8	Therfore yf they wyll not beleue the nether heare the voyce of the fyrst token, yet wyll they beleue for the voyce of the seconde token.
Exod.4.9	But and yf they wyll not beleue the two signes, nether herken vnto thy voyce, thou shalt take of the water of the ryuer, Ꟶ powrest vpon the drye lande. And the water which thou takest out of the ryuer, shall turne to bloude vpon the drye lande.
Exod.4.10	Moses sayde vnto the Lorde: oh my Lorde, I am not eloquent from yester daye Ꟶ yeryesterdaye, Ꟶ namely sence thou hast spoken vnto thy seruaunte: but I am slowe mouthed and slowe tonged.
Exod.4.11	And the Lorde sayde vnto hym: who hath made mans mouth, or who hath made the domme or the deaff, the seynge or the blynde? haue not I the Lorde?
Exod.4.12	Therfore I will be with thy mouth, Ꟶ teache the what thou shalt saye.
Exod.4.13	He sayde: oh my Lorde, sende I praye the by the hande of him whom thou wilt sende.
Exod.4.14	And the Lorde was angrye with Moses, Ꟶ sayde: do not I knowe Aaron thy brother the leuyte, that he can speake? For lo, he commeth furth to mete the, Ꟶ when he seyth the, he wylbe glad in his herte.
Exod.4.15	Therfore thou shalt speake vnto hym, and put these wordes in hys mouth, and I wylbe with thy mouth and wyth hys mouth, and wyll teache you what ye ought to do.
Exod.4.16	And he shalbe thy spokesman vnto the people: he also shall be thy mouth Ꟶ thou shalt be hys God:
Exod.4.17	and thou shalt take this rodd in thy hande, wherwith thou shalt do myracles.
Exod.4.18	Therfore Moses went and returned to Iethro hys father in lawe agayne, Ꟶ sayde vnto him: I wyll go nowe, and turne agayne vnto my brethren whych are in Egypte, and se whether they be yet alyue. And Iethro sayde to Moses, goo in peace.
Exod.4.19	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses in Midian: goo, and returne agayne in to Egypte for they are dead which went aboute to kyll the.
Exod.4.20	And Moses toke hys wyfe, and his sonnes, Ꟶ put them on an asse, and went agayne to Egypte, Ꟶ Moses toke the rodd of God in his hande.
Exod.4.21	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: when thou art entred Ꟶ come into Egypte agayne, se that thou doo all the wondres before Pharao which I haue put in thy hande: but I wyll holde hys herte, and he shall not let the people goo.
Exod.4.22	And thou shalt saye vnto Pharao, thus sayeth the Lorde: Israel is myne eldest sonne,
Exod.4.23	and I haue sayde vnto the that thou shuldest let my sonne goo, that he maye serue me. And thou woldest not let hym goo: beholde, I wyll slee thyne eldest sonne.
Exod.4.24	And it chaunced by the waye in the ynne that the Lorde mett hym, and wolde haue kylled him.
Exod.4.25	And zephora toke a stone, Ꟶ cut awaye the foreskyne of hyr sone, Ꟶ fell at his fete, Ꟶ sayde: a bloudyhusbande art thou vnto me.
Exod.4.26	Then he lett him goo. And she sayde a bloudy husbande, because of the circumcysion.
Exod.4.27	Then sayde the Lorde vnto Aaron: go mete Moses in the wildernesse. And he went and met hym in the mount of God, and kyssed him.
Exod.4.28	And Moses tolde Aaron all the wordes of the Lorde which had sent him, and all the tokens which he had charged him withall.
Exod.4.29	So went Moses Ꟶ Aaron and gathered all the elders of the chyldren of Israel.
Exod.4.30	And Aaron tolde all the wordes whych the Lorde had spoken vnto Moses, and dyd the myracles in the syght of the people,
Exod.4.31	and the people beleued. And when they herde that the Lorde had visited the chyldren of Israel and had loked vpon their tribulacyon, they bowed their head, and worshypped.
Exod.5.1	Moses Ꟶ Aaron went in after warde, and tolde Pharao, thus sayeth the Lorde God of Israel: Let my people goo, that they maye kepe holye daye vnto me in the wildernesse.
Exod.5.2	And Pharao sayde: who is the Lorde, that I shulde heare hys voyce, Ꟶ let Israell goo?
Exod.5.3	I knowe not the Lorde, nether will I let Israel goo. And they sayde: the God of the Hebrews hath mett with vs: and therfore wyll we go .iij. dayes iourney into the deserte, and sacrifyce vnto the Lorde oure God: lest there happen vnto vs ether pestylence or swerde.
Exod.5.4	Then sayde the kynge of Egypte vnto them: wherfore do ye, Moses and Aaron let the people from their worke, get you vnto your laboure.
Exod.5.5	And Pharao sayde furthermore: beholde, there is moche people nowe in the lande, and ye make them leaue their worke.
Exod.5.6	And Pharao commaunded the same daye vnto the taskemasters which were amonge the people, and vnto the offycers, sayinge:
Exod.5.7	ye shall geue the people no more strawe, to make brycke wyth all, (as ye dyd in tyme passed.) let them goo and gather them strawe them selues
Exod.5.8	and the nombre of brycke whyche they were wont to make in tyme passed, laye vnto their charges also, and mynysh nothynge therof. For they be ydell and therfore crye sayinge: we wyll goo Ꟶ do sacrifyce vnto oure God.
Exod.5.9	They must haue more worke layed vpon them, that they maye laboure therin, Ꟶ not regarde vayne wordes.
Exod.5.10	Than went the taskemasters of the people and the offycers out: and tolde the people Thus sayeth Pharao: I wyll geue you no moare strawe,
Exod.5.11	goo youre selues and gather you strawe where ye can fynde it, yet shall none of youre laboure be minyshed.
Exod.5.12	And so were the people scatered abrode thorowe out all the lande of Egypte for to gather stubbyll in stead of strawe.
Exod.5.13	And the taskemasters hasted them forwarde sayinge: fulfyll youre worke daye by daye, euen as yf ye had strawe.
Exod.5.14	And the offycers of the chyldren of Israel whych Pharaos taskemasters had sett ouer them, were beaten. And they sayde vnto them: wherfore haue ye not fulfylled youre taske in makinge brycke, both yesterdaye and to daye, as well as in tymes past?
Exod.5.15	The offycers also of the chyldren of Israel came Ꟶ complayned vnto Pharao, sayinge: wherfore dealest thou thus wyth thy seruauntes?
Exod.5.16	there is no strawe geuen vnto thy seruauntes, and they saye vnto vs: make brycke. And thy seruauntes are beaten, and thy people is foule intreated.
Exod.5.17	He sayde: ydell ar ye, ydell, and therfore ye saye: We wyll goo and do sacrifyce vnto the Lorde.
Exod.5.18	Goo therfore nowe and worke, and ther shall no strawe be geuen you, and yet shall ye delyuer the hole tale of brycke.
Exod.5.19	And the offycers of the chyldren of Israel dyd wyth heuynes loke on them that sayde: ye shall minyshe nothynge of youre daylye makynge of brycke.
Exod.5.20	And they mett Moses and Aaron, which stode in there waye as they came out from Pharao,
Exod.5.21	Ꟶ sayde vnto them: The Lorde loke vnto you and iudge you, whych hath made the sauoure of vs stincke in the eyes of Pharao Ꟶ in the eyes of his seruauntes, and haue put a swerde in their hande to slee vs.
Exod.5.22	Moses returned vnto the Lorde Ꟶ sayde: Lorde wherfore hast thou dealte cruelly wt this people: and wherfore hast thou sent me?
Exod.5.23	For sence I came to Pharao to speake in thy name, he hath fared foule wyth thys folke, and yet thou hast not delyuered thy people at all.
Exod.6.1	Then the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: Nowe shalt thou see, what I wyll doo vnto Pharao, for in a myghtye hande shall he let them goo, and in a myghtye hande shall he dryue them out of hys lande.
Exod.6.2	And God spake vnto Moses, and sayde vnto him: I am the Lorde,
Exod.6.3	I appeared vnto Abraham Isahac and Iacob as an allmyghtye God: and in my name Iehouah was I not knowne vnto them.
Exod.6.4	Moreouer I made an appoyntment with them to geue them the lande of Canaan: the lande of their pilgremage where in thy were straungers.
Exod.6.5	And I haue also herde the gronynge of the chyldren of Israel, whom the Egyptians kepe in bondage, and haue remembred my couenaunt.
Exod.6.6	Wherfore saye vnto the chyldren of Israel: I am the Lorde, I wyll brynge you out from the burdens of the Egyptians, and wyll rydd you out of their bondage, Ꟶ wyll delyuer you in a stretched out arme and in great iudgementes.
Exod.6.7	And I wyll take you for my people, Ꟶ wyll be to you a God. And ye shall knowe, that I am the Lorde youre God which brynge you out from the burdens of the Egyptians.
Exod.6.8	And I wyll brynge you vnto the lande concernynge the whych I dyd lyft vp my hande to geue it vnto Abraham, Isahac and Iacob, and wyll geue it vnto you for a possessyon: euen I the Lorde.
Exod.6.9	And Moses tolde the chyldren of Israel euen so: But they harkened not vnto Moses, for anguyshe of sprete and for cruel bondage.
Exod.6.10	The Lorde spake vnto Moses sayinge:
Exod.6.11	Goo in, Ꟶ speake vnto Pharao kynge of Egypte, that he let the chyldren of Israel goo out of hys lande.
Exod.6.12	And Moses spake before the Lorde sayinge: beholde, the chyldren of Israel herken not vnto me, howe than shall Pharao heare me? which am of vncircumcised lyppes?
Exod.6.13	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses and vnto Aaron, and gaue them a charge vnto the chyldren of Israel and vnto Pharao kynge of Egypte: to brynge the chyldren of Israel out of the lande of Egypte.

Exod.6.27	These are that Moses and Aaron which spake to Pharao kynge of Egypte, that they myghte brynge the chyldren of Israel out of Egypte.
Exod.6.28	And in the daye when the Lorde spake vnto Moses in the lande of Egypte,
Exod.6.29	he spake vnto hym, sayinge: I am the Lorde. speake thou vnto Pharao the kinge of Egypte all that I saye vnto the.
Exod.6.30	And Moses sayde before the Lorde: Beholde, I am of vncircumcised lyppes, and howe shall Pharao geue me audience?
Exod.7.1	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: beholde, I haue made the Pharaos God, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophete.
Exod.7.2	Thou shalt speake all that I commaunded the, and Aaron thy brother shall speake vnto Pharao, that he sende the chyldren of Israel out of hys lande.
Exod.7.3	And I wyll harden Pharaos hert, and multiplie my myracles and my wondres in the lande of Egypte.
Exod.7.4	But Pharao shall not herken vnto you, that I maye sett myne hand vpon Egypte, and brynge out myne armyes, and my people the chyldren of Israel out of the lande of Egypte, in great iudgementes,
Exod.7.5	and the Egyptians shall knowe, that I am the Lorde: when I stretche forth my hande vpon Egypte, and brynge out the chyldren of Israel from amonge them.

Exod.7.13	and he hardened Pharaos herte: that he herkened not vnto them, euen as the Lorde had sayde.
Exod.7.14	The Lorde also sayde vnto Moses. Pharaos herte is hardened, he refuseth to let the people goo.
Exod.7.15	Get the vnto Pharao in the mornynge, lo, he wyll come vnto the water, and thou shalt stonde vpon the ryuers brynke agaynst he come, and the rodd whyche turned to a serpente, shalt thou take in thyne hande.
Exod.7.16	And thou shalt saye vnto hym: the Lorde God of the Hebrues hath sente me vnto the, sayinge let my people goo, that they maye serue me in the wildernes: And beholde, hyther to thou woldest not heare.
Exod.7.17	Thus sayth the Lorde: In thys thou shalt knowe that I am the Lorde. Beholde, I wyll smyte (with the staffe that is in myne hande) the water that is in the ryuer, and it shall turne to bloude.
Exod.7.18	And the fyshe that is in the ryuer shall dye, and the ryuer shall stynke: and it shall greue the Egyptians to dryncke of the water of the ryuer.
Exod.7.19	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saye vnto Aaron: take thy staffe, and stretche out thyne hande ouer the waters of Egypte, ouer their streames, ouer their ryuers and pondes and all pooles of water, whych they haue, that they maye be bloude, and that there maye be bloud thorowe out all the lande of Egypte: both in vessels of wodd and also of stone.
Exod.7.20	And Moses and Aaron dyd euen as the Lorde commaunded. And he lyfte vp the staffe and smote the waters that were in the ryuer in the syghte of Pharao and in the syghte of hys seruauntes, and all the water that was in the ryuer, turned into bloud.
Exod.7.21	And the fyshe that was in the ryuer dyed and the ryuer stanke: and the Egyptians coulde not dryncke of the waters of the ryuer. And there was bloude thorowe out all the lande of Egypte.
Exod.7.22	And the enchaunters of Egypte dyd lykewyse wyth their sorceries, and he hardened Pharaos hert: neyther dyd he harken vnto them as the Lorde had sayde.
Exod.7.23	And Pharao turned hym selfe, and went agayne into hys housse, and let not hys herte there vnto.
Exod.7.24	And the Egyptians dygged rounde aboute the ryuer for water to drynke, for they coulde not drynke of the water of the ryuer.
Exod.7.25	And it continued a weke after that the Lorde had smyten the ryuer.
Exod.8.1	The Lorde spake vnto Moses: Goo vnto Pharao Ꟶ tell him; thus sayeth the Lorde: lett my people goo, that they maye serue me.
Exod.8.2	If thou wylt not let them goo: beholde, I wyll smyte all thy border wt frogges.
Exod.8.3	And the ryuer shall scrall wyth frogges, whych shall go vp and come into thyne house and in to thy preuy chambre where thou slepest, and vpon thy bedd, and into the house of thy seruauntes, Ꟶ vpon thy people, and into thyne ouens, and vpon thy meates.
Exod.8.4	And the frogges shall come vpon the and on thy people and vpon all thy seruauntes.
Exod.8.5	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses: saye vnto Aaron: stretche forth thyne hande with thy rodd ouer the stremes, ouer the ryuers, and ouer the pondes, that thou mayest brynge vp frogges vpon the lande of Egypte.
Exod.8.6	And Aaron stretched hys hande ouer the waters of Egypte, and the frogges came vp, Ꟶ couered the lande of Egypte.
Exod.8.7	And the sorcerers dyd lyke wyse wt theyre sorcery, and brought frogges vp vpon the lande of Egypte.
Exod.8.8	Then Pharao called for Moses Ꟶ Aaron and sayde praye ye vnto the Lorde, that he maye take awaye the frogges from me Ꟶ from my people, and I wyll let the people goo, that they maye do sacrifyce vnto the Lorde.
Exod.8.9	And Moses sayde vnto Pharao: reioysse thou ouer me, and appoynte when I shall praye for the and for thy seruauntes, and for thy people, to dryue awaye the frogges from the, and thy houses, and that they maye remayne but in the ryuer only.
Exod.8.10	He sayde: tomorowe. And he sayde: euen as thou hast sayde, that thou mayest knowe that there is none lyke vnto the Lorde oure God.
Exod.8.11	And so the frogges shall departe from the and from thy houses, from thy seruauntes and from thy people, and shall remayne in the ryuer only.
Exod.8.12	Moses and Aaron went out from Pharao, and Moses cryed vnto the Lorde vpon the apoyntment of frogges, which he had made vnto Pharao.
Exod.8.13	And the Lorde dyd accordynge to the sayinge of Moses. And the frogges dyed out of the houses, out of the courtes and feldes.
Exod.8.14	And they gathred them together vpon heapes, Ꟶ the lande stanke of them.
Exod.8.15	But when Pharao sawe that he had rest geuen him, he hardened hys herte and herkened not vnto them, as the Lorde had sayde.
Exod.8.16	And the Lord sayde vnto Moses: saye vnto Aaron: stretche out thy rodd and smyt the dust of the lande, that it maye turne to lyse thorowe out all the lande of Egypte.
Exod.8.17	And they dyd so. For Aaron stretched out his hande Ꟶ with his rodd he smote the dust of the erth, which turned to lyse in man and beest, so that all the dust of the lande turned to lyse, thorowe out all the lande of Egypte.
Exod.8.18	And the enchaunters assayde lykewyse with their enchauntmentes to brynge forth lyse, but they coulde not. And the lyse were both vpon men and beestes.
Exod.8.19	Then sayde the enchaunters vnto Pharao: it is the fyngre of God. And Pharaos hart remayned obstinate, and he harkened not vnto them, euen as the Lorde had sayde.
Exod.8.20	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: ryse vp early in the mornyng, and stande before Pharao, for he wyll come forth vnto the water: and thou shalt saye vnto him: thus saith the Lorde: Let my people go, that they maye serue me.
Exod.8.21	Els, yf thou wylt not let my people goo, beholde, I wyll sende all maner of flyes both vpon the and thy seruauntes, and thy people, and into the houses. And the houses of the Egipcians shalbe full of flyes, and the grounde wheron they are.
Exod.8.22	And the lande of Gosan where my people are, will I cause to be wonderfull in that daye: so that ther shall no flyes be there. Wherbye thou shalt knowe, that I am the Lorde in the myddes of the erth.
Exod.8.23	And I wil put a diuision betwene my people and thyne. And euen tomorowe shall this myracle be done.
Exod.8.24	The Lorde dyd euen so: and there came noysome flies into the house of Pharao, and into his seruauntes houses, and into all the lande of Egipt: and the lande was corrupte with these flyes.
Exod.8.25	And Pharao called for Moses and Aaron, and sayde: Go, and do sacrifice vnto youre God in the lande.
Exod.8.26	And Moses answered: it is not mete that we so do. For then we must offer vnto the Lorde our God, that which is an abhomination vnto the Egipcians. But and yf we sacrifice that, which is an abhomination vnto the Egipcians before their eyes, shulde they not stone us?
Exod.8.27	we will go thre dayes iorneye into the deserte, and sacrifice vnto the Lord our God as he hath commaunded vs.
Exod.8.28	And Pharao sayd: I will let you go, that ye maye sacrifice vnto the Lorde youre God in the wildernesse: but go not farre awaye, praye for me.
Exod.8.29	And Moses sayde: beholde, I will go out from the, Ꟶ praye vnto the Lorde, that the flyes maye departe from Pharao, Ꟶ from his seruauntes and from his people to morow. But let Pharao from hensforth deceaue nomore, that he will not let the people go to sacrifice vnto the Lorde:
Exod.8.30	And Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed vnto the Lorde.
Exod.8.31	And the Lorde dyd accordinge to the sayinge of Moses: and the flyes departed from Pharao, and from hys seruauntes, and from his people, and there remayned not one.
Exod.8.32	And Pharao hardened his herte euen then also, and dyd not let the people go.
Exod.9.1	The Lorde sayd vnto Moses: go in vnto Pharao and thou shalt tell him: thus sayth the Lorde God of the Ebrues: lett my people go, that they maye serue me.
Exod.9.2	If thou wilt not let them go, and wylt holde them styll,
Exod.9.3	beholde, the hande of the Lorde is vpon thy flocke which is in the felde: for vpon hostes, asses, camels, oxen and shepe, there shalbe a mighty great morayne.
Exod.9.4	And the Lorde shall do wonderfully betwene the beastes of Israel and the beastes of Egypt: so that there shall nothynge dye of all that pertayneth to the children of Israel.
Exod.9.5	And the Lorde appointed a tyme, saying: to morow the Lorde shall finysh this worde in the lande.
Exod.9.6	And the Lorde dyd it on the morow, and all the catell of Egipt dyed: but of the catell of the chyldren of Israel dyed not one.
Exod.9.7	And Pharao sent, and beholde, ther was not one of the catell of the Israelites deed. And the hert of Pharao was hardened that he wolde not let the people go.
Exod.9.8	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses and Aaron: take youre handes full of asshes out of the fornace, and Moses shall sprynkle it vp into the ayre, in the syght of Pharao,
Exod.9.9	and it shall turne to dust in all the lande of Egipt: that ther maye be swellyng sores with blaynes both on man and beaste thorowout all the lande of Egipte.
Exod.9.10	And they toke asshes oute of the fornace, and stode before Pharao, and Moses sprynkled it vp into the ayre. And there were sores with blaynes both in men and in beastes:
Exod.9.11	and the sorcerers coulde not stande before Moses because of the blaines: for ther were botches vpon the enchaunters Ꟶ vpon all the Egipcians.
Exod.9.12	And the Lord hardened the hert of Pharao, Ꟶ he herkened not vnto them, as the Lorde had sayd vnto Moses.
Exod.9.13	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: ryse vp early in the mornynge, and stande before Pharao, Ꟶ thou shalt tell hym: thus sayth the Lord God of the Ebrues: Let my people go, that they maye serue me:
Exod.9.14	or els I will at this tyme sende all my plages vpon thine herte, and vpon thy seruauntes and on thy people, that thou mayest knowe, that there is none lyke me in all the earth.
Exod.9.15	For nowe I wyll stretch out my hande, that I maye smyte the and thy people with pestilence: and thou shalt perysh from the earth.
Exod.9.16	And in very dede for this cause haue I kepte the, for to shewe the my power: and that they might declare my name thorowout all the world.
Exod.9.17	Yet thou exaltest thy selfe agaynste my people, that thou wylt not let them go:
Exod.9.18	beholde, to morowe thys tyme I wyll sende downe a myghty great hayle: euen soche a one as was not in Egipt, sens it was grounded vnto thys tyme.
Exod.9.19	Sende therfore nowe, and gather thy beastes, and all that thou hast in the felde. For vpon all the men and the beastes which are founde in the felde, and not brought home, shall the hayle fall, and they shall dye.
Exod.9.20	And as many as feared the worde of the Lorde among the seruauntes of Pharao, made their seruauntes and their beastes flee into the houses:
Exod.9.21	but he that regarded not the worde of the Lorde, left his seruauntes and his beastes in the felde.
Exod.9.22	And the Lorde said vnto Moses: stretch forth thyne hande vnto heauen, that there maye be hayle in all the lande of Egipt: vpon man and vpon beastes and vpon all the herbes of the felde, thorowout the lande of Egipt.
Exod.9.23	And Moses stretched out his rod vnto heauen: and the Lord thondred and hayled, and the fyrr ran a longe vpon the grounde. And the Lorde so hayled in the lande of Egypt,
Exod.9.24	that there was hayle and fyer mengled with the hayle, so greuous, and such as there was none thorowout all the lande of Egipte, sence people inhabited it.
Exod.9.25	And the hayle smote thorowout all the lande of Egipt, all that was in the felde both man and beast. And the hayle smote all the herbes of the felde, and broke all the trees of the felde:
Exod.9.26	onely in the lande of Gozan, where the children of Israel were, was there no hayle.
Exod.9.27	And Pharao sent Ꟶ called for Moses and Aaron, and sayde vnto them: I haue nowe synned: the Lorde is ryghteous: and I and my people are vngodly.
Exod.9.28	Praye ye vnto the Lorde: for it is moch that there shulde be thonders of God Ꟶ hayle. I will let you go, and ye shall tary no longer.
Exod.9.29	Moses sayde vnto him: assone as I am out of the citye, I will sprede abrode my handes vnto the Lorde, Ꟶ the thonder shall cease. nether shall there be eny more hayle, that thou mayst knowe howe that the erth is the Lordes.
Exod.9.30	But I knowe that thou and thy seruauntes yet feare not the face of the Lorde God.
Exod.9.31	And so the flaxe and the barly were smyten: for the barly was shot vp, and the flaxe was boulled:
Exod.9.32	but the whete and the rye were not smytten: for they were late sowne.
Exod.9.33	And Moses went out of the citye from Pharao and sprede abrode his handes vnto the Lorde: and the thonder and hayle ceased nether rayned it vpon the earth.
Exod.9.34	And when Pharao sawe that the rayne and the hayle and thonder were ceased, he synned agayne: and hardened his herte, he and his seruauntes.
Exod.9.35	And the hert of Pharao was hardened: nether wolde he let the children of Israel go, as the Lorde had sayde by the hande of Moses.
Exod.10.1	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: go in vnto Pharao: for I haue hardened his herte and the herte of hys seruauntes, that I might put these my sygnes amongest them:
Exod.10.2	and that thou tell in the audience of thy sonne, and of thy sonnes sonne, what thinges I haue done in Egipte, and the myracles which I haue done amonge them: that ye maye knowe howe that I am the Lorde.
Exod.10.3	And so Moses and Aaron came vnto Pharao, Ꟶ sayd vnto him: Thus sayth the Lorde God of the Ebrues: howe longe shall it be or thou wylt submitte thy selfe vnto me? Let my people go, that they maye serue me.
Exod.10.4	Or els, and wylt not let my people go, behold, to morow will I bring greshoppers into thy coastes,
Exod.10.5	Ꟶ they shall couer the face of the earth, that it cannot be sene: and they shall eate the residue which remayneth vnto you, and is escaped from the hayle: Ꟶ they shall eate euery grene tree that beareth you frute in the felde,
Exod.10.6	and they shall fyll thy houses, and all thy seruauntes houses, and the houses of all the Egipcyans after soche a maner as nether thy fathers, nor thy fathers fathers haue sene, sens the time they were vpon the earth vnto this daye. And he turned him selfe aboute, and went out from Pharao.
Exod.10.7	And Pharaos seruauntes sayd vnto him: Howe longe shall he be a slaunder vnto vs? Let the men go, that they maye serue the Lorde their God: knowest thou not yet that Egipt is destroied?
Exod.10.8	And Moses Ꟶ Aaron were brought agayne vnto Pharao, and he sayde vnto them: Go, and serue the Lorde youre God. Who are they that shall go?
Exod.10.9	And Moses answered: we will go with oure yonge and with our olde: yee, and with our sonnes and with oure daughters, and with oure shepe, and wt oure oxen we must go. For we must holde a feaste vnto the Lorde.
Exod.10.10	And he sayde vnto them: let it be so. The Lorde be with you. When I let you go, and your children also take hede, for ye haue some mischefe in hande.
Exod.10.11	Naye, not so: but go they that are men, and serue the Lorde: for that was your desyre. And they thrust them out of Pharaos presence.
Exod.10.12	And the Lord sayd vnto Moses: Stretch out thyne hande ouer the lande of Egipt for gresshoppers, that they maye come vpon the lande of Egipt, and eate all the herbes of the lande, Ꟶ all that the hayle left behynde.
Exod.10.13	And Moses stretched forth his rod ouer the lande of Egipt: Ꟶ the Lorde brought an east winde vpon the lande, all that daye, and all that nyght. And in the morning, the east wynde brought the greshoppers,
Exod.10.14	and the greshoppers went vp ouer all the lande of Egipt: and remayned in all quarters of Egipt very greuously. Before them were ther no soch greshoppers, nether after them shalbe:
Exod.10.15	for they couered all the face of the earth: so that the land was darke. And they dyd eate all the herbes of the lande, and all the frutes of the trees, and whatsoeuer the hayle had lefte: there was no grene thinge lefte in the trees and herbes of the felde thorowe all the lande of Egipte.
Exod.10.16	Therfore Pharao called for Moses Ꟶ Aaron in haste, Ꟶ sayde: I haue synned agaynst the Lorde youre God Ꟶ against you.
Exod.10.17	And nowe forgeue me my sinne only this once: Ꟶ pray vnto the Lorde your God, that he maye take awaye from me this deeth only.
Exod.10.18	And Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed vnto the Lorde:
Exod.10.19	Ꟶ the Lorde turned a mightye strong west winde, and it toke awaye the greshoppers and cast them into the redd see: so that there was not one greshopper in all the coaste of Egipt.
Exod.10.20	And the Lorde hardened Pharaos herte, so that he wolde not lett the children of Israel go.
Exod.10.21	And the Lorde sayd vnto Moses: stretch out thy hande vnto heauen, that there maye be vpon the lande of Egipt darcknes, which maye be felt.
Exod.10.22	And Moses stretched forth his hande vnto heauen, and there was a thicke darcknes vpon all the lande of Egipt thre dayes longe,
Exod.10.23	no man sawe another, nether rose vp from the place where he was by the space of thre dayes: but all the children of Israel had lyght where they dwelled.
Exod.10.24	And Pharao called for Moses, Ꟶ sayde: go, and serue the Lorde, only let youre shepe and youre oxen abyde, and let your children go with you.
Exod.10.25	And Moses sayde: thou must geue us also offeringes and burntofferinges for to sacrifyce vnto the Lorde our God:
Exod.10.26	our catell also shall go with vs, Ꟶ there shall not one hoffe be left behinde: for therof must we take to serue the Lorde oure God. Neyther do we knowe what we shall offre vnto the Lorde, vntyll we come thyther.
Exod.10.27	But the Lorde hardened Pharaos herte: and he wolde not let them go.
Exod.10.28	And Pharao sayde vnto him: get the fro me, and take hede to thy selfe, and se my face nomore. For whensoeuer thou commest in my syght, thou shalt dye.
Exod.10.29	And Moses saide: Let it be as thou hast sayde, I wyll se thy face nomore.
Exod.11.1	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: yet wyll I brynge one plage more vpon Pharao and vpon Egipte: and after that, he wyll let you go hence. And when he letteth you go, he shall vtterly driue you hence.
Exod.11.2	Speake thou therfore in the eares of the people, that euery man borowe of his neyghbour, and euery womaan of her neyghboures iewels of syluer and iewels of golde.
Exod.11.3	And the Lord shall gyue the people fauour in the syght of the Egipcians. Moreouer, Moses was very great in the lande of Egipt, in the syght of Pharaos seruauntes and in the sight of the people.
Exod.11.4	And Moses sayde: thus sayth the Lorde: At mydnight wyll I go out into the middes of Egipte,
Exod.11.5	and all the fyrste borne in the lande of Egipt shall dye, euen from the fyrst borne of Pharao that sytteth on his seate, vnto the fyrst borne of the mayde seruaunte that is behynde the mylle, and all the fyrste gendred of the catell.
Exod.11.6	And there shalbe a great crye thorowout all the lande of Egipt, such as there was neuer none lyke, nor shalbe.
Exod.11.7	But amonge the chyldren of Israel, shall not a dogge moue his tonge, nor yet man or beast: that ye maye knowe howe that the Lorde, putteth a difference betwene the Egipcyans and Israel.
Exod.11.8	And these thy seruauntes shall all come downe vnto me. And fall before me, and saye: gett the out and all the people that are vnder the, and then wyll I departe. And he went oute from Pharao with an angry countenaunce.
Exod.11.9	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: Pharao shall not heare you, that my wonders may be multiplyed in the lande of Egipte.
Exod.11.10	And Moses and Aaron dyd all these wonders. before Pharao. And the Lorde hardened Pharaos herte, so that he wolde not let the chyldren of Israel go out of his lande.
Exod.12.1	And the Lord spake vnto Moses and Aaron in the lande of Egipt, sayinge:
Exod.12.2	Thys monethe shalbe vnto you the beginning of monethes: and the fyrst moneth of the yeare shall it be vnto you.
Exod.12.3	Speake ye vnto all the congregacyon of Israel, saying: In the .x. daye of thys moneth, euery man take vnto him a lambe, according to the house of the fathers, a lambe thorowout euery house.
Exod.12.4	Yf the housholde be to lytle for the lambe, let hym take hys neyghboure which is nexte vnto his house according to the nombre of the soules: euery one of you, according to his eating, shal make your counte for a lambe.
Exod.12.5	And let the lambe of yours be wtout blemysh, a male of a yeare olde, which ye shall take out from amonge the shepe, or from amonge the goates.
Exod.12.6	And ye shall kepe him in vntyll the .xiiij. daye of the same moneth. And euery man of the multitude of Israel shall kyll him about euen.
Exod.12.7	And they shall take of the bloud, Ꟶ strike it on the .ij. syde postes Ꟶ on the vpperdorepost euen in the houses, where they shall eate hym.
Exod.12.8	And they shall eate the flesh the same night: rost wt fyer Ꟶ wt vnleuended bread, Ꟶ wt sowre herbes they shall eate it.
Exod.12.9	Se that ye eate not therof rawe ner soden in water, but roste wt fier: the head, fete, Ꟶ purtenaunce therof.
Exod.12.10	And ye shall let nothyng of it remayne vnto the morning. That which remayneth of it vntyll the morowe, shall ye burne with fyer.
Exod.12.11	Of this maner shall ye eate it: with your loynes gyrded, and your shoes on your fete, and your staues in your handes. And ye shall eate it in haste: for it is the Lordes passeouer:
Exod.12.12	for I wyll passe thorowe the lande of Egipt this same nyght, and wyll smytte all the first borne in the land of Egipt, both of man and beaste, and vpon all the goddes of Egipt will I the Lord do execution.
Exod.12.13	And the bloude shalbe vnto you a token in the houses wherin ye are. And when I se the bloud, I will passe ouer you, and the plage shal not be vpon you to destroye you, when I smyte the lande of Egipte.
Exod.12.14	And this daye shalbe vnto you a remembraunce: and ye shall kepe it holy vnto the Lorde, euen thorowout youre generatyons shall ye kepe it holy daie, that it be a custome for euer.
Exod.12.15	Seuen dayes shall ye eat vnleuended bread: and the fyrste daye ye shall put a waye leuen out of youre houses. For whosoeuer eateth leuended bread from the fyrst daye vntill the seuenth daye, that soule shalbe plucked out from Israel.
Exod.12.16	The fyrste daye shalbe an holy conuocation, and the seuenth daye shalbe an holy conuocation vnto you. There shalbe no maner of worcke done in them, saue about that onely which euery man must eate, that onely maye ye do.
Exod.12.17	And ye shall obserue vnleuended bread. For this same daye haue I brought your armyes out of the lande of Egypte, therfore ye shall obserue this daye, Ꟶ all your children after you, by a custome for euer.
Exod.12.18	The fyrst moneth and the .xiiij. daye of the moneth at euen, ye shall eate swete bread vnto the .xxj. daye of the moneth at euen agayne.
Exod.12.19	Seuen dayes shall there be no leuended breade founde in youre houses. And whosoeuer eateth leuended bread, that soule shalbe roted out from the multitude of Israel: whyther he be a straunger or borne in the lande.
Exod.12.20	Ye shall eate nothyng leuended: but in all your habitations shall ye eate swete bread.
Exod.12.21	Moses called for the elders of Israel, and sayde vnto them: chose out and take you to euery housholde of you a shepe, and kyll it for passeouer.
Exod.12.22	And take a bunche of ysope, Ꟶ dyp it in the bloude that is in the basen, and stryke the vpperposte and the two syde postes with the bloud that is in the basen, and none of you go out at the dore of hys house, vntyll the mornyng.
Exod.12.23	For the Lorde will go about to smyte the Egipcians. And when he seeth the bloude vpon the vpper dore poste Ꟶ on the two side postes: he will passe ouer the dore, and will not suffer the destroyer to come into your house to plage you.
Exod.12.24	Therfore shall ye obserue this thing, that it be an ordinaunce both to the and thy sonnes for euer.
Exod.12.25	And when ye become into the land which the Lorde wyll geue you, accordynge as he hath promysed, ye shall kepe thys seruyce.
Exod.12.26	And when youre chyldren aske you what maner of seruyce is this ye do,
Exod.12.27	ye shall saye: it is the sacrifyce of the Lordes passe ouer, which passed ouer the houses of the children of Israel in Egipte, as he smote the Egypcians, and saued oure houses. And the people bowed them selues, and worshypped:
Exod.12.28	And the chyldren of Israel went, and dyd as the Lorde had commaunded Moses and Aaron. Euen so dyd they.
Exod.12.29	And at mydnight, the Lorde smote all the fyrst borne in the lande of Egipte, from the fyrst borne of Pharao that satte on hys seate, vnto the fyrst borne of the captyue that was in preson: and all the fyrste gendred of catell.
Exod.12.30	And Pharao arose in the nyghte, he and all his seruauntes and all the Egipcians: and there was a greate cryinge in Egipt: for there was no house where there was not one deed.
Exod.12.31	And he called vnto Moses and Aaron by nyght, saying: ryse vp, and get you oute from amonge my people: both ye and also the children of Israel, and go and serue the Lorde as ye haue sayde.
Exod.12.32	And take youre shepe and your droues with you as ye haue sayde, and departe and blesse me.
Exod.12.33	And the Egypcians were fierce vpon the people, that they myght sende them out of the lande in haste: for they sayde: we dye all.
Exod.12.34	And the people toke their dowgh before it was sowred, and theyr vitayles bounde in clothes vpon theyr shoulders.
Exod.12.35	And the children of Israel dyd accordyng to the saying of Moses: and they borowed of the Egipcyans iewelles of siluer, and iewelles of golde, and rayment.
Exod.12.36	And the Lorde gaue the people fauoure in the syght of the Egippcians: so that they graunted soch thinges as they required. And they robbed the Egypcians.
Exod.12.37	And the children of Israel toke their iorneye from Rameses to Suchoth syxe hundred thousande men of fote, besyde children.
Exod.12.38	And moch comon people went also wt them, and shepe, and oxen, and exceadynge great flocke.
Exod.12.39	And they baked swete cakes of the dowgh which they brought out of Egipt, for it was not sowred. For when they were thrust oute by the Egipcyans, they coulde not tarie to prepare them selues any prouisyon of meate:
Exod.12.40	The dwellinge of the children of Israel, which they dwelled in Egipte, was .iiij. hundred and .xxx. yeares:
Exod.12.41	and when the .iiij. hundred and .xxx. yeares were expired, euen the selfe same daye departed all the hoostes of the Lorde out of the lande of Egipt,
Exod.12.42	It is a nyght to be obserued to the Lorde, in the which he brought them oute of the lande of Egypte. Thys is that nyghte of the Lorde which all the chyldren of Israel muste kepe thorowout theyr generations.
Exod.12.43	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses and Aaron: This is the lawe of passeouer: there shall no straunger eate therof.
Exod.12.44	But euery seruaunt that is bought for money (after that thou hast circumcised him) shall eate therof.
Exod.12.45	A straunger and a hyerd seruaunt shall not eate therof.
Exod.12.46	In one house shall it be eaten. Thou shalte carye none of the fleshe oute at the house. Neyther shall ye breake a bone therof.
Exod.12.47	All the multitude shall obserue it.
Exod.12.48	If a straunger also dwell amonge you, Ꟶ will holde passeouer vnto the Lorde, let him circumcyse all that be males: and then lett him come and obserue it, and he shall be as one that is borne in the lande. For no vncircumcised persone shall eate therof.
Exod.12.49	One maner of lawe shalbe vnto him that is borne in the lande, and vnto the straunger that dwelleth amonge you.
Exod.12.50	And all the chyldren of Israel dyd as the Lorde commaunded Moses and Aaron. Euen so dyd they.
Exod.12.51	And the self same daye dyd the Lorde bring the chyldren of Israel out of the lande of Egipt with their armyes.
Exod.13.1	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying:
Exod.13.2	Sanctify vnto me all the first borne, that open all maner matrices amonge the children of Israel aswell of man as of beaste: for it is myne.
Exod.13.3	And Moses sayd vnto the people: thynke on this daye in which ye came out of Egipt, out of the house of bondage: for thorow a mightye hande the Lord brought you out from thence. There shall no leuended bread be eaten.
Exod.13.4	This daye come ye out in the moneth when corne beginneth to rype.
Exod.13.5	When the Lorde hath brought the into the lande of the Cananites, Hethites, Amorites, Heuites Ꟶ Iebusites: which he sware vnto thy fathers that he wold geue the a lande wherin mylcke Ꟶ hony floweth, thou shalt kepe this seruice in thys same moneth:
Exod.13.6	Seuen dayes thou shalte eate swete bread: and in the seuenth daye, it is the feaste of the Lord.
Exod.13.7	Swete bread shalbe eaten seuen daies: and ther shall no leuended bread be sene, nor yet leuen with the in all thy quarters.
Exod.13.8	And thou shalt shewe thy sonne in that daie sayinge: this is done, because of that which the Lord dyd vnto me, when I came out of Egipte.
Exod.13.9	And it shalbe a signe vnto the vpon thyne hande, and for a remembraunce betwene thyne eyes, that the Lordes lawe maye be in thy mouth. For in a stronge hand the Lorde brought the out of Egipt.
Exod.13.10	Kepe therfore this ordynaunce in his ceason from yeare to yeare.
Exod.13.11	And it will come to passe, that the Lord shall bring the into the lande of the Cananites, which he sware vnto the and to thy fathers: and shall geue it the.
Exod.13.12	And then thou shalt appointe vnto the Lorde all that openeth the matrice. And euery caste thing, the fyrst doth open the matrice of a beast which thou hast: yf they be males, they shall be the Lordes.
Exod.13.13	And euery fyrst gendred of an asse, thou shalt redeme with a lambe: yf thou redeme him not, thou shalt breake his neck. All the fyrst borne amonge thy chyldren also, shalt thou bye out.
Exod.13.14	And when thy sonne asketh the to morowe, sayinge what is this, thou shalt saye vnto him: With a mightye hande the Lorde brought vs out of Egipt, out of the house of bondage.
Exod.13.15	And when Pharao was looth to let vs go, the Lorde slewe all the first borne in the lande of Egipte: aswell the fyrste borne of man as of beaste. Therfore I sacrice vnto the Lorde all the males that open the matrice, and all the fyrst borne of my children I redeme.
Exod.13.16	This shalbe a token vpon thyne hande, and a remembraunce betwene thyne eyes, that the Lorde brought vs out of Egipte thorowe a mightye hande.
Exod.13.17	It came to passe, that whan Pharao had lett the people go, God caryed them not thorowe the waye and lande of the Philistines, which was the more nye waye. But God sayde: lest the people happly repent whan they se warre: Ꟶ so turne agayne to Egipte.
Exod.13.18	But God led the people about thorowe the waye of the wildernes of the redd see. And the children of Israel went vp harnessed out of the lande of Egipte.
Exod.13.19	And Moses toke the bones of Ioseph with him: for he made the children of Israel swere, saying God will surely viset you, and ye shall take my bones awaye hens with you.
Exod.13.20	And they toke their iorneye from Sucoth: and abode in Etham in the edge of the wildernes.
Exod.13.21	And the Lorde wente before them by daye in a pyller of a cloude to leade them the waye: and by nyght in a pyller of fyer to geue them lyght, that they might go both by daye and nyght.
Exod.13.22	The pyller of the cloude departed not by daye, nor the pyller of fyer by night out of the sight of the people.
Exod.14.1	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying:
Exod.14.2	Speake to the children of Israel, that they turne and remayne before Pi Hiroth betwene Migdol and the see, oueragaynst Baalzephon: and before that shall they pitch by the see.
Exod.14.3	For Pharao wyll saye of the children of Israel: they are tangled in the lande, the wildernes hath shut them in.
Exod.14.4	And I will harden Pharaos hert, that he shall folowe after you: and I will get me honoure vpon Pharao and vpon all his hoost, the Egipcians also shall knowe that I am the Lorde. And they dyd euen so.
Exod.14.5	And it was tolde the king of Egipt that the people fled. And the hert of Pharao and of his seruauntes turned agaynst the people and they sayde: why haue we this done that we haue let Israel go out of our seruice?
Exod.14.6	and he made ready his charettes: and toke hys people with him
Exod.14.7	and toke syxe hundred chosen charettes and all the charettes of Egipt and captaynes vpon euery one of them.
Exod.14.8	And the Lord hardened the hert of Pharao kyng of Egipt, and he folowed after the chyldren of Israel. But the children of Israel wente out with an hye hande:
Exod.14.9	and the Egipcians folowed after them, and all the horses and charettes of Pharao and his horsemen and his hoost ouertoke them abyding by the see, besyde Pi Hiroth before Baal zephon.
Exod.14.10	And when Pharao drewe nie, the children of Israel lyft vp their eyes and beholde, the Egipcians folowed after them, and they were sore afrayde: and the children of Israel cryed out vnto the Lorde.
Exod.14.11	But they sayde vnto Moses: because there were no graues in Egipt, hast thou therfore brought vs awaye for to dye in the wyldernes? wherfore hast thou serued vs thus, for to carye vs out of Egipte?
Exod.14.12	Dyd not we tell the this in Egipt, saying: let vs be in rest, that we maye serue the Egipcians? For it had bene better for vs to haue serued the Egipcians then for to dye in the wildernesse.
Exod.14.13	And Moses sayde vnto the people: feare ye not, stande styll, Ꟶ beholde, howe the Lorde shall saue you this daie. For ye that haue sene the Egipcians this daye, shall se them nomore for euer.
Exod.14.14	The Lorde shall fyght for you, and ye shall holde your peace.
Exod.14.15	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: wherfore cryest thou vnto me? speake vnto the children of Israel that they go forwarde.
Exod.14.16	But lyfte thou vp thy rodd, and stretche oute thy hande ouer the see, and deuide it a sondre, and let the children of Israel go on drye grounde thorowe the middest of the see.
Exod.14.17	And behold, I will harden the hert of the Egipcians that they maye folowe them. And I wyll get me honoure vpon Pharao and vpon all his host, and vpon his charettes and vpon his horsmen.
Exod.14.18	And the Egipcians shall knowe that I am the Lorde when I haue gotten me honoure vpon Pharao, vpon his charettes and vpon his horsmen.
Exod.14.19	And the angell of God which went before the hoost of Israel remoued, and beganne to go behynde them. And the clowden piller that was before the face of them beganne to stonde behynde them,
Exod.14.20	and came betwene the hoost of the Egipcians and the hooste of Israel. It was also a darcke clowde, and gaue lyght by nyght: and all the nyght long the one came not at the other.
Exod.14.21	And Moses stretched forth hys hande ouer the see: and the Lord caryed awaye the see by a verye stronge easte wynde all that nyght, and made the see drye lande, and the waters were deuyded.
Exod.14.22	And the children of Israel went into the myddest of the see vpon the drye grounde. And the waters were a walle vnto them, on their ryght hande, and on their lefte hande.
Exod.14.23	And the Egipcians folowed and went in after them to the myddest of the see, euen all Pharaos horses, hys charettes and his horsemen.
Exod.14.24	And in the morning watch, the Lorde loked vnto the hoost of the Egipcians out of the fyery and clowdy pyller: and troubled the hoost of the Egipcians,
Exod.14.25	and toke of hys charet wheles Ꟶ caryed them awaye violently. So that the Egipcians sayde: Let vs fle from the face of Israel: for the Lorde fighteth for them agaynst the Egipcians.
Exod.14.26	And the Lorde sayd vnto Moses: stretch out thyne hande ouer the see, that the waters maye come agayne vpon the Egipcian, vpon his charettes and vpon his horsemen.
Exod.14.27	And Moses stretched forth hys hande ouer the see, and it came agayne to his course rarly in the mornynge, and the Egipcians fledd agaynst it. And the Lorde ouerthrew the Egipcians in the myddest of the see:
Exod.14.28	and the water returned and couered the charettes and the horsmen: and all the hoost of Pharao that came into the see after them, so that there remayned not one of them.
Exod.14.29	But the chyldren of Israel walked vpon drye lande thorowe the myddest of the see, and the waters were a walle vnto them on the ryght hande of them, and on the left.
Exod.14.30	Thus the Lorde delyuered Israel the selfe same daye out of the hande of the Egipcians: and Israel sawe the Egipcians deed vpon the see syde.
Exod.14.31	And Israel sawe that mightye power which the Lord shewed vpon the Egipcians: and the people feared the Lorde, and beleued the Lorde and his seruaunt Moses.
Exod.15.1	Then Moses Ꟶ the chyldren of Israel sange this songe vnto the Lord and sayde: I wyll syng vnto the Lorde: for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and him that rode vpon him hath he ouerthrowne in the see.
Exod.15.2	The Lord is my strength and prayse, and he is become my saluacion. He is my God, and I wyll glorify hym: my fathers God, Ꟶ I wyll exalte hym.
Exod.15.3	The Lorde is a man of warre. The Lorde is hys name.
Exod.15.4	Pharaos charettes and his hoost hath he caste into the see. Hys chosen captaynes also are drowned in the red see,
Exod.15.5	the depe waters haue couered them: they soncke to the botome as a stone.
Exod.15.6	Thy ryght hande Lorde, is become glorious in power: thy ryght hande Lorde hath all to dashed the enemy.
Exod.15.7	And in thy greate glory thou hast ouerthrowne them that rose vp agaynst the: thou sentest forth thy wrath which consumed them euen as stobell.
Exod.15.8	Thorowe the winde of thy nastrels the water gathered together, the floudes stode styll as an heape, and the depe water congeled together in the hert of the see.
Exod.15.9	The enemye sayd: I wyll folowe on them: I will ouertake them, I will deuyde the spoyle, I wyll satisfye my lust vpon them, I wyll drawe my sweard, myne hande shall destroye them.
Exod.15.10	Thou blewdest wt thy wynde, the see couered them, they sancke as leed in the mightye waters.
Exod.15.11	Who is lyke vnto the, o Lorde, among goddes? who is lyke the so glorious in holynes, fearfull in prayses, shewing wonders?
Exod.15.12	Thou stretchedest out thy ryght hande, the erth swalowed them.
Exod.15.13	Thou in thy mercye hast caryed thys people which thou deliueredst: Ꟶ hast brought them in thy strength vnto thy holy habitatyon.
Exod.15.14	The nations heard and were afrayed, sorowe came vpon the Philistines.
Exod.15.15	Then the dukes of the Edomites were amased, and the mightyest of the Moabites, tremblynge came vpon them: all the inhabiters of Canaan waxed faynte harted:
Exod.15.16	Lett feare and dreade fall vpon them in the greatnes of thyne arme, let them be as styll as a stone, tyll thy people passe thorowe, O Lorde, whyle thys people passe thorowe, which thou hast goten.
Exod.15.17	Thou shalte brynge them in, and plante them in the mountayne of thyne enheritaunce, the place, Lord, which thou hast made for to dwell in, the sanctuary, o Lorde, which thy handes haue prepared.
Exod.15.18	The Lorde shall raigne euer and all waye.
Exod.15.19	For Pharaos horse went in wt his charettes and horsemen into the see, Ꟶ the Lord brought the waters of the see vpon them. But the children of Israel went on drye land in the myddest of the see.
Exod.15.20	And Mir Iam a prophetysse the syster of Aaron toke a tymbrell in her hande, Ꟶ all the wemen came out after her wt tymbrels Ꟶ daunces.
Exod.15.21	And Mir Iam sange before them: Synge ye vnto the Lorde: for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse Ꟶ his ryder hath he ouerthrowne in the see.
Exod.15.22	And so Moses brought Israel from the redd see, Ꟶ they went out into the wildernes of Sur. And they went thre dayes longe in the wildernes, and founde no waters.
Exod.15.23	And whan they came to Mara, they coulde not drincke of the waters of Mara: for they were bytter: therfore the name of the place was called, Mara,
Exod.15.24	And the people murmured agaynst Moses, sayinge: what shall we drincke?
Exod.15.25	And he cried vnto the Lorde: and the Lorde shewed hym a tree, which when he had cast into the water, the waters were made swete. There he made them an ordinaunce and a lawe, and there he proued him,
Exod.15.26	Ꟶ sayde: If thou wylt herken vnto the voyce of the Lorde thy God, and wylt do that which is right in his sight, and wylt geue eare vnto his commaundementes, Ꟶ kepe all hys ordinaunces: then wyll I put none of these diseases vpon the which I brought vpon the Egipcians: for I am the Lorde that healeth the.
Exod.16.1	The children of Israel came to Elim where were xii. welles of water and .lxx. palme trees, and they abode there by the waters.
Exod.16.2	And they toke their iorney from Elim: Ꟶ all the hole company of the children of Israel came to the wildernes of Sin, which is betwene Elim and Synai: the .xv. day of the .ij. moneth after their departyng out of the lande of Egypt.
Exod.16.3	And the hole multitude of the children of Israel murmured agaynst Moses and Aaron in the wyldernes:
Exod.16.4	and the children of Israel sayde vnto them: wolde to God we had died by the hande of the Lorde in the lande of Egypte, when we sat by the fleshepottes, and when we dyd eate bread our belyes full: for ye haue brought vs out into this wyldernes, to kyll thys hole multitude with honger.
Exod.16.5	Then sayde the Lorde vnto Moses: behold, I wyll rayne bread from heauen to you, and the people shall go out, and gather daye by daye that I may proue them, whither they will walke in my lawe or no.
Exod.16.6	The .vj. daye they shal prepare for them selues that which they wyll bryng in, and let it be twise asmoch as they gather in dayly.
Exod.16.7	And Moses Ꟶ Aaron sayde vnto all the children of Israel: at euen ye shall knowe that it is the Lorde, which brought you out of the lande of Egypt:
Exod.16.8	and in the morning, ye shall se the glory of the Lorde: because he hath heard your grudginges agaynst the Lorde. And what are we that ye haue murmured against vs?
Exod.16.9	And Moses sayde: At euen shall the Lorde geue you flesh to eate, and in the mornyng bread ynough: for the Lorde hath hearde your murmurynges which ye murmur agaynst him: for what are we? your murmuringes are not against vs, but agaynst the Lorde.
Exod.16.10	And Moses spake vnto Aaron: Saye vnto all the company of the children of Israel, come forth before the Lorde: for he hath heard your grudgynges.
Exod.16.11	And as Aaron spake vnto the hole multytude of the chyldren of Israel, they loked towarde the wildernes: and beholde, the glorye of the Lorde appeared in the cloude.
Exod.16.12	And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying:
Exod.16.13	I haue hearde the murmurynge of the chyldren of Israel, tell them therfore and saye: at euen ye shall eate flesh, and in the morning ye shalbe fylled with breed, and ye shall knowe that I am the Lord your God.
Exod.16.14	And at euen the quayles came and couered the grounde where they laye. And in the morninge, the dewe laye rounde about the hooste.
Exod.16.15	And when the dewe was fallen: beholde it laye vpon the grounde in the wyldernes, small Ꟶ round and thyn as the hore frost on the grounde.
Exod.16.16	And when the chyldren of Israel sawe it, they sayde euery one to hys neyghboure: It is Manna. For they wist not what it was. And Moses sayde vnto them: this is the breed which the Lord hath geuen you to eate.
Exod.16.17	This is the worde which the Lorde hath commaunded: gather of it euery man for him self to eate: a gomer full for a man according to the nombre of you, and take euery man for them which are in his tente.
Exod.16.18	And the chyldren of Israel dyd euen so, Ꟶ gathered some more, some lesse,
Exod.16.19	and when they dyd mete it with a gomer, vnto hym that had gathered moch, remayned nothing ouer, and vnto him that had gathered litle, was there no lacke: euery man gathered sufficient for his eatyng.
Exod.16.20	And Moses sayde vnto them: Se that no man let ought remayne of it tyll the mornyng.
Exod.16.21	Not withstondyng they harkened not vnto Moses: but some of them lefte of it vntyll the mornyng, and it waxed full of wormes and stancke, and Moses was angry with them.
Exod.16.22	And they gathered it all morninges, euery man for hys eatynge. And assoone as the heate of the sunne came, it moulte.
Exod.16.23	And the sixte day, they gathered twise so moch breed two gomers for one man: Ꟶ all the rulers of the multitude came, Ꟶ tolde Moses.
Exod.16.24	He sayd vnto them: this is that which the Lorde hath sayde: tomorow is the rest of the holy Sabbath vnto the Lord: bake that which ye will bake, and seth that ye will seth, and that which remayneth, laye vp tyll the mornynge.
Exod.16.25	And they layde it vp tyll the mornynge, as Moses bad: and it stanke not, nether breed there any worme therin.
Exod.16.26	And Moses sayde: that eate thys daye: for it is the Sabbath vnto the Lorde: todaye ye shall not fynde it in the felde.
Exod.16.27	Syxe dayes ye shall gather it, and in the seuenth daye which is the Sabbath, there shalbe none.
Exod.16.28	Notwithstondyng, there went out some of the people in the seuenth daye for to gather, Ꟶ they founde none.
Exod.16.29	And the Lord sayde vnto Moses: howe longe refuse ye to kepe my commaundmentes and my lawes?
Exod.16.30	Se, the Lorde hath geuen you a Sabbath, therfore he geueth you the syxte daye bread for two dayes. Byde therfore euery man at home Ꟶ lett no man go out of hys place the seuenth daye.
Exod.16.31	And the people rested the seuenth daye.
Exod.16.32	And the house of Israel called it Manna. And it was lyke vnto coriander seede, whyte: and the taste of it was like vnto wafers made with hony.
Exod.16.33	And Moses sayd: this is that which the Lorde commaundeth, fyll a gomer of it, which maye be kept for youre children after you: that they maye se the bread wherwith I haue fedd you in wyldernesse, when I brought you out of the lande of Egipt.
Exod.16.34	And Moses spake vnto Aaron: take a cruse and put a gomer full of Manna therin, and laye it vp before the Lorde to be kepte for yor children after you,
Exod.16.35	as the Lorde commaunded Moses. So Aaron layde it vp before the testimonye to be kept.
Exod.16.36	And the chyldren of Israel dyd eate Manna fourtye yeare, vntyll they came vnto a lande inhabited. And so they dyd eate Manna euen vntyll they came vnto the borders of the land of Canaan.Exo
Exod.17.1	And all the company of the chyldren of Israel thorowout their armies went from the wyldernes of Sin after the commaundement of the Lorde, and pytched in Raphidim: where was no water for the people to drincke.
Exod.17.2	And the people chode with Moses, and sayde: geue vs water to drincke. Moses sayde vnto them: why chyde ye with me? wherfore do ye tempte the Lorde?
Exod.17.3	There the people thirsted for water, and the people murmured agaynst Moses, Ꟶ sayde: wherfore hast thou thus brought vs oute of Egipte: to kyll vs and oure chyldren and catell with thyrste?
Exod.17.4	And Moses cryed vnto the Lorde, saying: what shall I do vnto thys people? they be allmoost ready to stone me.
Exod.17.5	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: go before the people, and take wt the of the elders of Israel, Ꟶ thy rod wherwith thou smotest the ryuer, take in thyne hande, and go.
Exod.17.6	Beholde, I stonde before the besyde a rocke that is in Horeb: Ꟶ thou shalt smyte the rocke, and there shall come water out therof, that the people maye dryncke. And Moses dyd euen so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.
Exod.17.7	And he called the name of the place Masse and Meriba. because of the chidynge of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lorde, sayinge: is the Lorde amonge vs or not?
Exod.17.8	Then came Amalech and fought with Israel in Raphidim.
Exod.17.9	And Moses sayde vnto Iosua: chose vs oute men, and goo fyghte with Amalech. And tomorow I will stonde on the toppe of the hyll, and the rodd of God shalbe in my hande.
Exod.17.10	Iosua did as Moses bade hym, Ꟶ foughte with Amalech. And Moses, and Aaron, Ꟶ Hur went vp to the toppe of the hyll.
Exod.17.11	And it happened, that when Moses helde vp his hande, Israel had the better. And when he late hys hande downe, Amalech had the better.
Exod.17.12	But Moses handes were heuye, and therfore they toke a stone and put it vnder hym, and he satt downe there on. And Aaron and Hur stayed vp his handes, the one on the one syde and the other on the other syde. And hys handes remayned stedye vntyll the goynge downe of the sonne.
Exod.17.13	And Iosua discomfeted Amalech and hys people, with the edge of the swerde.
Exod.17.14	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: writte thys for a remembraunce in a boke, and commite it vnto the eares of Iosua, for I will vtterly put out the remembraunce of Amalech from vnder heauen.
Exod.17.15	And Moses made an alter and called the name of it. The Lorde is he that worketh myracles for me.
Exod.17.16	For he sayde: the hande is on the seate of God the Lorde wyll haue warre with Amalech from generacyon to generacyon.
Exod.18.1	Iethro the prest of Midiam Moses father in lawe herde of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel hys people, and that the Lord had broughte Israel out of Egypte.
Exod.18.2	Therfore he toke ziphora Moses wyfe, (After he had sente her backe)
Exod.18.3	and hyr two sonnes, of which the one was called Gerson, for he sayd: I haue bene an alient in a straunge lande.
Exod.18.4	The name of the other was Eliesar: for the God of my father (sayde he) was myne helpe, and delyuered me from the swerde of Pharao:
Exod.18.5	And Iethro Moses Father in lawe came with his two sonnes Ꟶ his wyfe vnto Moses into the wildernesse: where he abode by the mount of God.
Exod.18.6	And he sayde vnto Moses: I thy father in lawe Iethro am come to the, and thy wyfe also and hyr two sonnes with her.
Exod.18.7	And Moses went oute to mete hys father in lawe and dyd obeyssaunce and kyssed hym and eache asked other of hys health, and they came into the tent.
Exod.18.8	And Moses tolde hys father in lawe all that the Lorde had done vnto Pharao and to the Egyptians for Israels sake, and all the trauayle that had happened them by the waye, and howe the Lorde delyuered them.
Exod.18.9	And Iethro reioysed ouer all the goodnesse whyche the Lorde had done to Israell, and because he had delyuered them out of the hande of the Egyptians.
Exod.18.10	And Iethro sayde: blessed be the Lorde whiche hath delyuered you oute of the hande of the Egyptians and out of the hande of Pharao, which hath also delyuered hys people from the captyuite of the Egyptians.
Exod.18.11	Nowe I knowe that the Lorde is greater then all goddes, for in the thynge wherby they dealt cruelly wyth them, are they them selues peryshed.
Exod.18.12	And Iethro Moses father in lawe offred burntofferynges and sacrifyces vnto God. And Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eate breade wyth Moses father in lawe before God.
Exod.18.13	And it chaunced on the morow, that Moses satt to iudge the people, and the people stode aboute Moses from mornynge vnto euen.
Exod.18.14	And whan Moses father in lawe sawe all that he did vnto the people, he sayd: what is thys that thou doest vnto the people? why syttest thou thy selfe alone, and all the people stonde aboute the from mornynge vnto euen?
Exod.18.15	And Moses sayde vnto hys father in lawe: because the people come vnto me to seke councell of God.
Exod.18.16	When they haue a matter, they come vnto me, and I iudge betwene euery man and hys neyghboure, and shewe them the ordynaunces of God and hys lawes.
Exod.18.17	And Moses father in lawe sayd vnto him: it is not well that thou doest.
Exod.18.18	Thou both weryest thy selfe, and thys people that is wt the: for thys thynge is of more weyght, then thou art able to perfourme thy selfe alone.
Exod.18.19	Heare nowe therfore my voyce, and I wyll geue the councell, and God shalbe with the. Be thou vnto the people to God warde, that thou mayest brynge the causes vnto God,
Exod.18.20	and thou shalt teache them ordinaunces and lawes, and shewe them the waye wherin they must walke, and the worke that they must doo.
Exod.18.21	Morouer thou shalt seke oute amonge all the people, men of actiuite, and such as feare God: true men, hatynge coueteousnes: and make them heedes ouer the people, captaynes ouer thousandes, ouer hundredes, ouer fyftye and ouer ten.
Exod.18.22	And let them iudge the people at all seasons. And euery greate matter that happeneth, let them bringe vnto the, but let them iudge all small causes them selues, and so shall it be easyer for thy selfe, and they shall bere with the.
Exod.18.23	If thou shalt do thys thinge, (and God charge the with all) thou shalt be able to endure, and yet the people shall come to theyr place in peace.
Exod.18.24	And so Moses obeyed the voyce of hys father in lawe, and did all that he had sayde,
Exod.18.25	and chose actyue men oute of all Israel and made them as heedes ouer the people: namely, captaynes ouer thousandes, ouer hundredes, ouerfyfty and ouerten.
Exod.18.26	And they iudged the people at all seasons, but broughte the harde causes vnto Moses: and iudged all small matters them selues.
Exod.18.27	And Moses let hys father in lawe departe, and he went into hys awne lande.
Exod.19.1	In the thyrde moneth, whan the children of Israel were gone oute of the lande of Egipt, the same daye came they into the wyldernesse of Sinay.
Exod.19.2	For they were departed from Raphidim, and were come to the deserte of Sinay, and had pitched theyr tentes in the wildernesse. And there Israel abode before the mounte.
Exod.19.3	But Moses went vp vnto God. And the Lorde called to hym out of the mountayne, sayinge: thus shalt thou saye vnto the house of Iacob, and tell the chyldren of Israel:
Exod.19.4	ye haue sene what I dyd vnto the Egyptians, and toke you vp vpon Eegles wynges, Ꟶ haue brought you vnto my selfe:
Exod.19.5	Nowe therfore yf ye wyll heare my voyce in dede, and kepe myne appoyntement: ye shall be myne awne, aboue all nacyons, for all the erth is myne.
Exod.19.6	Ye shall be vnto me also a kyngdome of preastes and an holy people: and these are the wordes which thou shalt saye vnto the chyldren of Israel.
Exod.19.7	Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and layde before theyr faces all these wordes which the Lorde commaunded hym.
Exod.19.8	And the people answered all to gether, and sayde. All that the Lorde hath sayde, we wyll doo. And Moses brought the wordes of the people vnto the Lorde.
Exod.19.9	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: Lo, I come vnto the in a thycke cloud, that the people maye heare me talkynge with the, and beleue the for euer. Moses shewed the wordes of the people vnto the Lorde.
Exod.19.10	And the Lorde sayd vnto Moses: Go vnto the people, and sanctifye them to daye and to morowe, and let them wash theyr clothes:
Exod.19.11	Ꟶ be redy agaynst the thyrde daye. For the thyrde daye the Lorde wyll come downe in the syght of all the people vpon mounte Sinay.
Exod.19.12	And thou shalt set markes rounde aboute the people and saye: beware, that ye go not vp into the mounte, or touche the bordre of it. Whosoeuer toucheth the mounte, shall surely dye.
Exod.19.13	There shall not an hande touch it: Els he shall be stoned or shot thorowe: whether it be beast or man, it shall not lyue: when the trompe bloweth longe, than maye they come vp into the mountayne.
Exod.19.14	And Moses went downe from the mounte vnto the people, and sanctifyed them, and they wasshed theyr clothes:
Exod.19.15	And he sayd vnto the people: be redye agaynst the thyrde daye, and come not at youre wyues.
Exod.19.16	And the thyrde daye in the mornynge there was thunder, and lyghtenynge, and a thycke clowde vpon the mounte, and the voyce of the trompe exceadynge lowde, so that all the people that was in the hoste was afrayed.
Exod.19.17	And Moses brought the people oute of the tentes to mete with God, and they stode vnder the hyll.
Exod.19.18	And mounte Sinay was all to gether on a smoke: because the Lorde descended downe vpon it in fyre. And the smoke therof ascended vp, as the smoke of a kele, and all the mount was exceadyng fearfull.
Exod.19.19	And whan the voyce of the trompe blewe and waxed lowder and lowder Moses spake, Ꟶ God answered him by a voyce:
Exod.19.20	And the Lorde came downe vpon mounte Sinay, euen in the toppe of the hyll, and whan the Lord called Moses vp into the toppe of the hyll. Moses went vp.
Exod.19.21	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: go downe: charge the people, that they prease not vp to se the Lorde, and so many of them perish.
Exod.19.22	And let the prestes also whych come to the Lorde sanctifye them selues, lest the Lorde destroye them.
Exod.19.23	And Moses sayde vnto the Lorde: the people cannot come vp into the mounte Synay, for thou chargedest vs saying: set markes aboute the hyll, and sanctifie it:
Exod.19.24	And the Lorde sayde vnto him: awaye, and get the downe: and thou shalt come vp, thou and Aaron with the. But let not the Prestes and the people presume for to come vp vnto the Lorde: lest he destroye them.
Exod.19.25	And so Moses went downe vnto the people and tolde them.
Exod.20.1	And God spake all these wordes and sayde:
Exod.20.2	I am the Lorde thy God, which haue brought the out of the lande of Egipte, oute of the house of bondage.
Exod.20.3	Thou shalt haue none other goddes in my syght.
Exod.20.4	Thou shalt make the no grauen ymage, nether any symilitude that is in heauen aboue, ether in the erth benethe, or in the waters vnder the erth.

Exod.20.6	and shewe mercye vnto thousandes in them that loue me and kepe my commaundementes.
Exod.20.7	Thou shalt not take the name of the Lorde thy God in vayne, for the Lorde wyll not holde him gyltlesse that taketh his name in vayne.
Exod.20.8	Remembre the Sabbath daye that thou sanctifye it.
Exod.20.9	Sixe dayes shalt thou laboure and do all that thou hast to do:
Exod.20.10	but the seuenth daye is the Sabbath of the Lorde thy God, in it thou shalt do no maner of worke, thou and thy sonne, and thy daughter, thy man seruaunte and thy mayde seruaunte, thy catell and the straunger that is within thy gates.
Exod.20.11	For in syxe dayes the Lorde made heauen and erth, the see and all that in them is, and rested the seuenth daye: wherfore the Lorde blessed the Sabbath daye and halowed it.
Exod.20.12	Honour thy father Ꟶ thy mother, that thy dayes maye be longe in the lande which the Lord thy God geueth the.
Exod.20.13	Thou shalt not kyll.

Exod.20.18	And all the people sawe the thunder and the lyghtenynge, and the noyse of the trompe, and the mountayne smokynge, And when the people sawe it, they remoued and stode a farre of,
Exod.20.19	and sayde vnto Moses: talke thou with vs, and we wyll heare: but let not God talke with vs, lest we dye.
Exod.20.20	And Moses sayde vnto the people: feare not, for God is come to proue you, and that his feare maye be in youre face, that ye synne not.
Exod.20.21	And the people stode a farre of, and Moses went into the thycke clowde where God was.
Exod.20.22	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: thus thou shalt saye vnto the chyldren of Israel. Ye haue sene that I haue talked with you from oute of heauen.
Exod.20.23	Ye shall not make therfore with me goddes of syluer neyther shall ye make you goddes of golde.
Exod.20.24	An alter of erth thou shalt make vnto me, and theron offer thy burntofferynges and thy peace offerynges, thy shepe and thyne oxen. In all places where I shall put the remembraunce of my name thyther I wyll come vnto the and blesse the.

Exod.31.12	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying:
Exod.31.13	Speake vnto the children of Israel and saye: In any wise se that ye kepe my Sabbathes: for it is a signe betwene me and you in your generacions, for to knowe that I the Lorde am he that doth sanctify you.
Exod.31.14	Kepe my Sabbath therfore: for it is holy vnto you. He that defyleth it, shalbe slayne. For whosoeuer worketh therin, the same soule shalbe roted oute from amonge hys people.
Exod.31.15	Syxe dayes shall men worcke. And in the seuenth daye is the Sabboth of the holye rest of the Lorde. Whosoeuer doth any worcke in the Sabboth daye, shall dye:
Exod.31.16	wherfore lett the children of Israel kepe the Sabboth, that they obserue it thorowout theyr generacions, that it be an appoyntment for euer.
Exod.31.17	For it is a signe betwene me and the chyldren of Israel for euer. For in syxe dayes the Lorde made heauen and earth: and in the seuenth daye he rested, and was refresshed.
Exod.31.18	And when the Lorde had made an ende of comening with Moses vpon the mounte Sinai, he gaue him two tables of witnes: euen tables of stone, wrytten with the fynger of God.
Exod.32.1	And when the people sawe, that yt was longe or Moses came downe out of the mountayne, they gathred them selues together vnto Aaron, and sayd vnto hym: Up, make vs goddes to go before vs: for of this Moses (the felowe that brought vs out of the lande of Egypt) we wote not what is become.
Exod.32.2	And Aaron sayde vnto them: plucke of the golden earynges which are in the eares of your wyues, your sonnes, and of your daughters: and bryng them vnto me.
Exod.32.3	And all the people plucked of the golden earynges, which they had in theyr eares, Ꟶ brought them vnto Aaron.
Exod.32.4	And he receaued them of their handes, and fassyoned it with a grauer, and made of it a calfe of molten metall. And they sayde: These be thy goddes, O Israel, which brought the oute of the lande of Egipt.
Exod.32.5	And when Aaron sawe that, he made an aultare before it. And Aaron cryed, sayinge: to morowe is the holy daye of the Lorde.
Exod.32.6	And they rose vp in the mornyng, Ꟶ offred burntofferinges, and brought peace offeringes also. And the people sat them downe to eate and dryncke, and rose vp agayne to playe.
Exod.32.7	And the Lorde sayd vnto Moses: go, get the downe: thy people which thou broughtest out of the lande of Egipt,
Exod.32.8	haue marred all, they are turned at once out of the waye, which I commaunded them: for they haue made them a calfe of molten metall, and haue worshypped it, and haue offered thereto, sayinge: These be thy goddes, O Israel, which hath brought the oute of the lande of Egipt.
Exod.32.9	And the Lorde sayde sayd vnto Moses: I haue sene this people: and beholde, it is a styffnecked people,
Exod.32.10	and nowe suffre me, that my wrath may waxe hote agaynst them, and consume them: and I wyll make of the a mightye people.
Exod.32.11	And Moses besought the Lord his God, and sayde: O Lorde, why doeth thy wrath waxe hote agaynst thy people, which thou hast brought oute of the lande of Egipte, wt greate power and with a mightye hande?
Exod.32.12	wherfore shulde the Egipcyans speake and saye: For a myschefe dyd he bryng them out euen for to sley them in the mountaynes, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turne from thy fearce wrath, and turne from thys euell (deuysed) agaynst thy people.
Exod.32.13	Remembre Abraham, Isaac and Israel thy seruauntes, to whom thou swareste by thyne awne selfe, and saydeste vnto them: I wyll multiplye your seede as the starres of heuen, and all this lande that I haue spoken of, wyll I geue vnto your seed: and they shall enheret it for euer.
Exod.32.14	And the Lord refrayned him selfe from that euell which he sayd he wolde do vnto hys people.
Exod.32.15	And Moses turned hys backe, and went downe from the hyll, and the two tables of witnesse were in hys hande: and the same tables were written on both the leaues,
Exod.32.16	and were the worcke of God, and the wrytynge was the wrytyng of God grauen in the tables.
Exod.32.17	And when Iosua hearde the noyse of the people, as they showted, he sayde vnto Moses: there is a noyse of warre in the host.
Exod.32.18	And he answered: it is not the crye of them that haue the mastry, nor of them that haue the worse: but I do heare the noyes of them that synge.
Exod.32.19	And it fortuned, assoone as he came nye vnto the hooste, he sawe the calfe and the daunsynge, and Moses wrath waxed hote, and he cast the tables out of his handes, and brake them beneth the hyll.
Exod.32.20	And he toke the calfe which they had made, and burned it in the fyer, and stampte it vnto powder, and strawed it in the water, and made the chyldren of Israel dryncke of it.
Exod.32.21	And Moses sayde vnto Aaron: what dyd thys people vnto the, that thou hast brought so greate a synne vpon them?
Exod.32.22	And Aaron answered: let not the wrath of my Lorde waxe fearce, thou knowest the people that they are euen sett on myschefe:
Exod.32.23	For they sayde vnto me: make vs goddes to go before vs, for we wote not what is become of Moses, the felowe that brought vs out of the lande of Egipte.
Exod.32.24	And I sayd vnto them: let them that haue golde pluck it of, and bring it me: and I cast it into the fier: and therof came out thys calfe.
Exod.32.25	Moses therfore sawe that the people were naked (and that Aaron had made them naked vnto theyr shame amonge theyr enemyes)
Exod.32.26	and he went and stode in the gate of the hoste, and sayde: If any man pertayne vnto the Lorde, let him come to me. And all the sonnes of Leui gathered them selues together,
Exod.32.27	Ꟶ came vnto him. And he sayde vnto them: Thus saith the Lorde God of Israel: put euery man his sweard by his syde, Ꟶ go in and out, from gate to gate thorowout the hooste: and sleye euery man, his brother and euery man hys companyon, and euery man hys neyghboure.
Exod.32.28	And the chyldren of Leui dyd as Moses had sayde. And there fell of the people the same daye about .iij.M. men.
Exod.32.29	And Moses sayde: fyll your handes vnto the Lorde this daye, euery man vpon hys sonne and vpon his brother and that ther maye be geuen you a blessing this daye.
Exod.32.30	And on the morowe it fortuned that Moses sayde vnto the people: Ye haue synned a great synne. And nowe I wyll go vp vnto the Lorde: yf paraduenture I maye purchace an atonement for your synne.
Exod.32.31	Moses therfore went agayne vnto the Lorde, Ꟶ sayde: Oh, thys people haue synned a greate synne and haue made them goddes of golde.
Exod.32.32	And nowe I praye the, eyther forgeue them their synne: or (yf thou wilt not) wipe me out of thy booke, which thou hast wrytten.
Exod.32.33	And the Lorde sayd vnto Moses: I will put hym out of my booke that hath synned agaynst me.
Exod.32.34	And nowe go thou, brynge the people vnto the place which I sayde vnto the: beholde, myne angell shall go before the. Neuerthelater in the daye when I vyset, I wyll vyset their synne vpon them.
Exod.32.35	And the Lorde plaged the people, because they made the calfe which Aaron made.
Exod.33.1	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: departe, and go hence: thou and the people, which thou hast brought out of the lande of Egypte, vnto the land which I sware vnto Abraham. Isahac and Iacob, sayinge: vnto thy seed will I geue it
Exod.33.2	(and I wyll sende an angel before the: and wyll cast out the Cananites, the Amorites and the Hethites, the Pherezites, the Heuites, and the Iebusites)
Exod.33.3	a lande that floweth with mylke and honye. For I wyll not go amonge you my selfe: for ye are a styffnecked people: lest I consume the in the waye.
Exod.33.4	And when the people heard this euell tidynges, they sorowed: and no man did put on hys best rayment.
Exod.33.5	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses: saye vnto the children of Israel: ye are a styfnecked people: I must come once sodenly vpon you, Ꟶ make an ende of you. Therfore nowe put thy goodly rayment from the, that I maye wete what to do vnto the.
Exod.33.6	And the chyldren of Israel layde their goodly rayment from them, euen by the mount Horeb.
Exod.33.7	And Moses toke the tabernacle, and pitched it withoute the hooste a farre of from the hoost: and called it the tabernacle of witnes. And so it came to passe, that euery one which wolde praye vnto the Lorde, wente out vnto the tabernacle of wytnesse, which was without the hooste.
Exod.33.8	And it fortuned, that when Moses went out vnto the tabernacle, all the people rose vp: and stode euery man at his tente dore: and loked after Moses, vntyll he was gone into the tabernacle.
Exod.33.9	And assoone as Moses was entred into the tabernacle, the clowdy piller descended, and stode at the doore of the tabernacle, and he talked with Moses.
Exod.33.10	And all the people saw the clowdy pyller stande at the tabernacles dore, and they rose vp, and worshipped euery man in his tente dore.
Exod.33.11	And the Lord spake vnto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh vnto his frende: and he turned agayne into the hoost. And the chylde Iosua hys seruaunte the sonne of Num, departed not oute of the tabernacle:
Exod.33.12	And Moses sayde vnto the Lorde: se, thou sayest vnto me: leade this people forth, and thou hast not shewed me whom thou wylte sende with me. And thou hast sayde moreouer: I knowe the by name, and thou hast also founde grace in my syght.
Exod.33.13	Nowe therfore yf I haue founde fauoure in thy syght, then shewe me thy waye, that I maye knowe the, and that I maye fynde grace in thy syghte. And consyder also, that thys nacyon is thy people.
Exod.33.14	And he sayde: my presence shall go with the: and I wyll geue the rest.
Exod.33.15	He sayde vnto hym: Yf thy presence go not with me, carye vs not hence:
Exod.33.16	for howe shall it be knowen here, that I and thy people haue founde fauoure in thy syght, but in that thou goest wt vs? Yf thou go with vs, shall not I and thy people haue preemynence before all the people that are vpon the face of the earth?
Exod.33.17	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: I will do this also that thou hast sayde, for thou hast founde grace in my syghte, and I knowe the by name.
Exod.33.18	And he sayde: I besech the, shewe me thy glorye.
Exod.33.19	And he sayde: I wyll make all my good go before the, and I wyll be called in this name of the Lorde before the and will shewe mercy to whom I wyll shewe mercye, and wyll haue compassyon on whom I wyll haue compassion.
Exod.33.20	And he sayd furthermore: thou mayst not se my face: for there shall no man se me, and lyue.
Exod.33.21	And the Lorde sayde: beholde, there is a place by me, Ꟶ thou shalt stonde vpon a rock:
Exod.33.22	and whyle my glory goeth forth, I will put the in a clyft of the rock: and wyll put myne hande vpon the, whyle I passe by.
Exod.33.23	And I wyll take awaye myne hande, Ꟶ thou shalt se my back partes: but my face shall not be sene.
Exod.34.1	And the Lorde sayde vnto Moses: hewe the two tables of stone lyke vnto the fyrst, and I will write vpon them the wordes that were in the first tables which thou brakest.
Exod.34.2	And be ready in the mornynge, that thou mayest come vp early vnto the mount of Sinai: and stand there with me in the top of the mount.
Exod.34.3	There shall no man come vp wt the, neyther let any man be sene thorowout all the mount, neyther let shepe nor oxen fede before the hyll.
Exod.34.4	And Moses hewed two tables of stone lyke vnto the fyrst, and rose vp early in the mornynge, and went vp vnto the mount of Sinai, as the Lorde had commaunded hym: and toke in his hande the two tables of stone.
Exod.34.5	And the Lorde descended in the clowde, and stode with hym there: and he called vpon the name of the Lorde.
Exod.34.6	And when the Lord walked before him, he cryed, Lorde Lorde God, mercyfull and gracyous, long suffering, Ꟶ aboundaunt in goodnes Ꟶ trueth,
Exod.34.7	Ꟶ kepyng mercye in store for thousandes, forgeuynge wikednes, vngodlynes Ꟶ synne, Ꟶ not leauynge one innocent, visytynge the wyckednes of the fathers vpon the children and vpon childrens children, euen vnto the third and fourth generacyon.
Exod.34.8	And Moses bowed him selfe to the earth quyckly, and worshipped,

Exod.40.16	And Moses dyd accordynge to all that the Lorde commaunded hym: euen so dyd he.
