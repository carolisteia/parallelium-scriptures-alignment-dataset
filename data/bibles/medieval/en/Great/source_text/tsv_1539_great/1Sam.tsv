1Sam.0.0	¶ The fyrst booke of Samuel called the fyrst booke of the Kynges.
1Sam.1.1	There was a man of one of the two Ramaths (of the kinred of zophim, of mount Ephraim) named Elkana the sonne of Ieroham the sonne of Elihu, the sonne of Thohu, the sonne of zuph, an Ephrathite:
1Sam.1.2	whych had two wyues, the one called Hanna, Ꟶ the other Phenenna. And Phenenna had children, but Hanna had none.
1Sam.1.3	And the sayd man went vp out of his citye euery feastfull daye, to praye Ꟶ to offer vnto the Lord of hostes in Silo, where were the two sonnes of Eli (Hophni Ꟶ Phinehes) the lordes prestes.
1Sam.1.4	And it fell on a solempne daye, that Elkana offered, and gaue to Phenenna his wife Ꟶ to all her sonnes and daughters porcyons.
1Sam.1.5	But vnto Hanna he gaue a porcion wt a heuye chere, for he loued Hanna, and the Lord had made her barren.
1Sam.1.6	And her enemye (Phenenna) vexed her sore contynually, to moue her, because the lord had made her barren.
1Sam.1.7	And so did she yere by yere as ofte as she went vp to the house of the lord. And so chafed her, which wepte, and did not eate.
1Sam.1.8	Then sayde Elkana her husband to her: Hanna, why wepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thyne herte troubled? am not I better to the, then ten sonnes?
1Sam.1.9	So Hanna rose vp after that they had eaten Ꟶ droncke in Sylo. And Eli the Preaste sate vpon a stole by one of the syde postes of the temple of the Lorde.
1Sam.1.10	And she was troubled in her mynde, and prayed vnto the Lord, Ꟶ wepte sore,
1Sam.1.11	and vowed a vowe, and sayd: O Lord of hostes, yf thou wylt loke on the trouble of thine handmayde, Ꟶ remembre me, and not forget thine handmayde, but geue vnto thine handmayde a man chylde: I wyll geue him vnto the Lord all the dayes of his lyfe, Ꟶ there shall no raser come vpon his heed.
1Sam.1.12	And as she continued praying before the lord, it fortuned, that Eli marked her mouth.
1Sam.1.13	For Hanna spake in her herte, Ꟶ her lyppes did but moue onely, but her voyce was not heard: Ꟶ therfore Eli thought she had bene droncken,
1Sam.1.14	and Eli sayd vnto her: How long wylt thou be droncken? put awaye from the, the wyne that thou hast.
1Sam.1.15	Hanna answered and sayde: not so my Lord, I am a woman of a sorowfull herte: I haue droncke nether wyne nor stronge drynck, but haue powred out my soule before the Lord.
1Sam.1.16	Count not thyne handmayde to be lyke a daughter of Belial, for out of the aboundance of my heuynes Ꟶ greafe: haue I spoken hitherto.
1Sam.1.17	Eli answered her agayne: Ꟶ sayde go in peace: the God of Israell graunt the thy peticyon, that thou hast asked of hym.
1Sam.1.18	She sayde: let thyne hand mayde fynde grace in thy sight And so the woman went her waye, Ꟶ dyd eat, Ꟶ loked no more so sadde.
1Sam.1.19	And they rose vp earlye, Ꟶ worshipped before the lord, Ꟶ then returned, Ꟶ came to theyr house to Ramath. And whan Elkana knew Hanna his wyfe, the Lord remembred her:
1Sam.1.20	for in processe of tyme it came to passe, that she conceaued, Ꟶ bare a sonne, Ꟶ called his name Samuel (sayeng:) because I haue asked him of the Lord.
1Sam.1.21	And Elkana Ꟶ all his house went vp to offer vnto the Lord, the offerynge due for the feast, Ꟶ also his vowe:
1Sam.1.22	Neuertheles, Hanna went not vp, but sayde vnto her husbande: I wyll tarye vntill the ladde be wened, Ꟶ then I wyll bring him that he maye apeare before the Lord, Ꟶ there abide for euer.
1Sam.1.23	Elkana her husband answered her: do what semith the best: tarye at home, vntill thou hast wened him, Ꟶ I besech the Lord, to make good his sayeng. And so the woman abode, Ꟶ gaue her sonne sucke, vntill she wened him.
1Sam.1.24	And when she had wened him she toke hym with her, with thre bullockes Ꟶ an Epha of floure, Ꟶ a bottel of wyne, and brought him vnto the house of the Lord in Silo, Ꟶ the child was yet but tender of age.
1Sam.1.25	And they slue a bullocke, Ꟶ brought in the ladd to Eli,
1Sam.1.26	and she sayd: Oh my Lord: as truly as thy soule lyueth my Lord, I am the woman that stode before the here, prayeng vnto the Lorde.
1Sam.1.27	For this ladde I prayed, and the Lorde hath geuen me my desire, whych I asked of him:
1Sam.1.28	and therfore I haue geuen hym vnto the Lord, as long as he is mete for the lorde. And they worshipped the Lorde there.
1Sam.2.1	And Hanna prayed and sayde: myne herte reioyseth in the Lord, and myne horne is exalted in the Lorde. My mouth is wyde open ouer myne enemyes, for I reioyse in thy saluacyon.
1Sam.2.2	There is none so holye as the Lord, for without the, is nothing. Nether is there any of strength as is oure God.
1Sam.2.3	Talke not to moche proudlye let olde thynges depart out of your mouthes, for the lorde is a God of knowledge, and his purposes come to passe.
1Sam.2.4	The bowe with the mightye men are broken: and they that were weake, haue girded them selues wt strength.
1Sam.2.5	They that were full, haue hired out them selues for breed, Ꟶ they that were hongrye, ceasse so to be, tyll the baren hath borne seuen: Ꟶ she that had many chyldren, is waxed feble.
1Sam.2.6	The Lord kylleth, and maketh alyue: bryngeth downe to the graue and fetcheth vp agayne.
1Sam.2.7	The Lorde maketh poore, Ꟶ maketh ryche: bringeth lowe, and heueth vp on hye.
1Sam.2.8	He reyseth vp the poore out of the dust, and lyfteth vp the begger from the dong hyll: to sett them amonge princes, and to enherett them with the seate of glorye. For the pillers of the erth are the lordes, and he hath sett the rounde worlde vpon them.
1Sam.2.9	He wyll kepe the fete of hys sayntes, and the wycked shall kepe sylence in darcknesse, Ꟶ in his awne myght shall no man be stronge.
1Sam.2.10	The lordes aduersaries shall be destroyed of hym: and out of heauen shall he thunder vpon euery one of them. The lorde shall iudge the endes of the worlde, Ꟶ shall gyue myght vnto his kynge, and exalte the horne of his anoynted.
1Sam.2.11	And Elkana went to Ramath to his house, Ꟶ the ladd dyd mynistre vnto the lorde before Eli the preaste.
1Sam.2.12	But the sonnes of Eli were chyldren of Belial, and knewe not the lord.
1Sam.2.13	And the Preastes made a lawe for the people, that whensoeuer any man offered any offerynge, the Preastes ladd came, while the fleshe was in sething, Ꟶ a fleshoke wyth thre tethe in his hand,
1Sam.2.14	and thrust it into the panne: ketle, caldren, or potte. And all that the fleshe hoke brought vp, that the Preaste toke awaye. And so they did vnto all the Israelites, that came thyther to Silo.
1Sam.2.15	Yee Ꟶ therto, before they burnt the fatte, the Preastes ladd came and sayd to the man that offered: geue flesh that I maye dresse it for the Preaste, for he wyll not haue sodden fleshe of the, but rawe.
1Sam.2.16	And yf any man sayde vnto hym: let them burne the fatt according to the daye, Ꟶ then take as moche as thine herte desyreth. The ladd wold answere him, yee, thou shalt geue it me now: and yf thou wylt not, I wyll take it with violence.
1Sam.2.17	And the synne of the youngmen was very great before the Lorde. For men abhorred the offeryng of the Lorde.
1Sam.2.18	But the child Samuel ministred before the Lorde, girded about wyth a lynen Ephod.
1Sam.2.19	Moreouer, hys mother made him a lytle coate, Ꟶ brought it to him from yere to yere, when she came vp with her husbande to offer the offeringe in the solempne feastes:
1Sam.2.20	and Eli blessed Elkana Ꟶ his wyfe, and sayde: the Lorde geue the seede of thys woman, for the peticyon that she asked of the lorde. And they went vnto their awne home.
1Sam.2.21	And the lorde visited Hanna, so that she conceaued Ꟶ bare thre sonnes Ꟶ two daughters. And the chylde Samuel grewe before the lorde.
1Sam.2.22	Eli was very olde, Ꟶ herde all that his sonnes dyd vnto all Israel, and how they laye with the wemen that wayted at the dore of the Tabernacle of wytnesse,
1Sam.2.23	Ꟶ he sayde vnto them: why do ye soche thynges? For of all these people I heare euell reportes of you.
1Sam.2.24	Oh, naye my sonnes: for it is no good reporte that I heare, how that ye make the lordes people to trespasse.
1Sam.2.25	If one man synne agaynst another, daysemen maye be iudges: but yf a man synne agaynst the lorde who will be his dayseman? Notwythstandyng, they herkened not vnto the voyce of their father, because the lorde wolde slaye them.
1Sam.2.26	The chylde Samuel profyted and grew, and was in fauoure both with the lorde, and also with men.
1Sam.2.27	And there cam a man of God vnto Eli, Ꟶ sayd vnto him: thus sayeth the lorde: dyd not I apeare vnto the house of thy father, when they were in Egipte subiect vnto Pharaos house?
1Sam.2.28	And I chose thy father out of all the trybes of Israel to be my Preaste, for to offer vpon myne aultare, Ꟶ to burne incense, and to weare an Ephod before me. And I gaue vnto the house of thy father all the burnt offrynges of the chyldren of Israell.
1Sam.2.29	Wherfore treade ye downe my sacrifice and myne offeryng, which I commaunded to be made in the Tabernacle, Ꟶ honorest thy chyldren aboue me, to make youre selues fatt of the first frutes of all the offerynges of Israel my people?
1Sam.2.30	Wherfore the lorde God of Israell sayeth: I sayde, that thy house and the house of thy father shuld walke before me for euer. But now the lorde sayeth: that be farre from me: for them that worshipe me, I will worshipe, Ꟶ they that despyse me, shall come to shame.
1Sam.2.31	Beholde, the dayes come, that I will cut of thyne arme, Ꟶ the arme of thy fathers house, that there shal not be an elder in thine house.
1Sam.2.32	And thou shalt se thyne enemye in the tabernacle of the lorde, Ꟶ in all that welthe which God shal giue Israell, Ꟶ there shall not be an elder in thyne house for euer.
1Sam.2.33	Neuerthelesse, I wyll not destroye all the males that come of the fro myne aultare. But to make thyne eyes dase, Ꟶ to make thyne hert melte. And all they that be multiplyed in thyne house, shall dye, yf they be men.
1Sam.2.34	And this shalbe a signe vnto the, that shall come vpon thy two sonnes Hophny Ꟶ Phinehes: euen in one daye they shall dye both.
1Sam.2.35	And I wyll stere me vp a faythfull preste, that shall do accordynge to my herte and mynde: And I will buylde him a sure house. And he shall walke before myne anoynted for euer.
1Sam.2.36	And they that are left in thyne house, shall come, and crouch to him for a lytle pece of syluer Ꟶ a cake of bread, Ꟶ shall saye: put me (I praye the) in one offyce or other amonge the prestes, that I maye eate a morsell of bread.
1Sam.3.1	And the chylde Samuel mynistred vnto the Lorde before Eli: Ꟶ the worde of the Lorde was precious in those dayes, nether was there any open visyon.
1Sam.3.2	And it chaunsed at that tyme, that Eli laye in his place, and hys eyes beganne to waxe dymme that he coulde not se.
1Sam.3.3	And yer the lampe of God went out, Samuel layde hym downe to slepe in the temple of the Lord, where the arcke of God was.
1Sam.3.4	And the Lorde called Samuel, Ꟶ he sayde, here am I,
1Sam.3.5	and he ran vnto Eli, Ꟶ sayd: here am I, for thou calledst me. And he sayd: I called the not: go agayne, Ꟶ slepe. And he went, and layde him downe to slepe.
1Sam.3.6	And the Lorde called once agayne: Samuel, Ꟶ Samuel arose Ꟶ went to Ely, Ꟶ sayd, I am here, for thou dyddest call me. And he answered: I called the not, my sonne. Go agayne, and take thy rest:
1Sam.3.7	Samuell knewe not yet the Lord, nether was the worde of the Lord yet opened vnto hym.
1Sam.3.8	And the Lorde went to, Ꟶ called Samuel the thyrd tyme. And he arose, Ꟶ went to Eli, Ꟶ sayde: I am here, for thou hast called me. And Eli perceaued that the Lorde had called the chylde.
1Sam.3.9	Therfore, Eli sayde vnto Samuel: go, Ꟶ lye downe: Ꟶ yf he call the agayne, then saye, speake on Lorde, for thy seruaunt heareth. So Samuel went, Ꟶ layed hym downe in hys place.
1Sam.3.10	And the Lord came, Ꟶ stode, Ꟶ called as before, Samuel Samuel. Samuel answered: speake on: for thy seruaunt heareth.
1Sam.3.11	And the Lord sayde to Samuel: beholde, I will do a thinge in Israel, that both the eares of as many as heareth it, shall tyngle.
1Sam.3.12	In that daye I wyll rayse vp agaynst Eli, all thynges whych I haue spoken concernynge his house: from the begynnyng to the endyng.
1Sam.3.13	I haue tolde him, that I wyll iudge hys house for euer. For the wickednes which he knoweth. For when the people cursed hys sonnes for the same wickednes, he hath not corrected them.
1Sam.3.14	And therfore, I haue sworne vnto the house of Eli, that the wyckednesse of Elies house, shall not be purged wt sacrifyce nor offering for euer.
1Sam.3.15	Samuel laye tyll the mornynge, and opened the dores of the house of the Lorde. And Samuel feared to shewe Eli the visyon.
1Sam.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel, Ꟶ sayde: Samuel my sonne. And he answered: here I am.
1Sam.3.17	He sayde: what is that the Lorde hath sayde vnto the? I praye the, se thou hyde it not from me. God do so, Ꟶ so to the, yf thou hyde any thyng from me, of all that he sayde vnto the.
1Sam.3.18	And Samuel tolde hym euery whytte, and hydd nothynge from hym. And he sayd: it is the Lorde, let him do what semeth hym best,
1Sam.3.19	And Samuel grewe, Ꟶ the Lorde was wyth him, Ꟶ left none of hys wordes vnperformed.
1Sam.3.20	And all Israel from Dan to Bersabe wyst that faythfull Samuel was made the Lordes prophete.
1Sam.3.21	And the Lord appered agayne in Silo: for the Lorde opened hym selfe to Samuel in Silo, thorow the worde of the Lorde.
1Sam.4.1	And Samuel spake vnto all Israel. And Israel went out against the Philistynes to battayle, and pytched besyde the helpe stone. And the Philistynes pytched in Aphek.
1Sam.4.2	And put them selues in araye against Israel. And when they ioyned the battell, Israel was put to the worse before the Philistines. And the Philistynes slue in araye alonge by the feldes, about a foure thousande men.
1Sam.4.3	And when the people were come into their tentes, the elders of Israel sayde: wherfore hath the Lorde cast vs downe this daye before the Philistines? let vs fetch the arcke of the appoyntment of the Lorde oute of Silo vnto vs, that when it commeth amonge vs, it maye saue vs, oute of the hande of oure enemy.
1Sam.4.4	And so the people sent to Silo, Ꟶ fet from thens the arcke of the appoyntment of the Lord of Hoostes, which dwelleth betwene the cherubins. And there were the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni, Ꟶ Phinehes with the arcke of the appoyntment of God.
1Sam.4.5	And it fortuned, that when the arcke of the appoyntment of the Lorde came into the hoost, all Israel showted a myghtie showte, so that the erthe rangge agayne.
1Sam.4.6	And whan the Philistines herde the noyse of the showte, they sayd: what meaneth the sounde of this mighty showt in the host of the Ebrues? And they vnderstode, howe that the arcke of the Lorde was come into the hoost:
1Sam.4.7	And the Philistines were afrayed, and sayde: God is come into the hoost. And they sayd agayne: Wo vnto vs, for it was neuer so before this:
1Sam.4.8	Wo vnto vs, who shall delyuer vs out of the hande of these mighty Goddes? these are the Goddes that smote the Egypcians with so many plages in the wyldernes.
1Sam.4.9	Be stronge and quite youre selues lyke men, O ye Philistynes, that ye be no seruauntes vnto the Ebrues, as they haue bene to you. Be of a manly corage therfore Ꟶ fyght.
1Sam.4.10	And the Philistines fought, Ꟶ Israel was put to the worse Ꟶ fledd euery man into his tente. And ther was an exceading great slaughter, for there were ouerthrowen of Israel .xxx.M. fotemen.
1Sam.4.11	And the arcke of God was taken, Ꟶ the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni, Ꟶ Phinehes were deed.
1Sam.4.12	And there ran a man of BenIamin out of the araye, and came to Silo the same daye with his clothes rent Ꟶ earth vpon hys heed.
1Sam.4.13	And when he came, Eli sate vpon a stole, and loked toward the waye: for his hert feared for the arcke of God. And when the man came into the cytie, and tolde it, all the cytie cryed.
1Sam.4.14	And when Eli herde the noyse of the cryeng he sayd: What meaneth this noyse of the rumor? And the man came in hastely, Ꟶ tolde Eli.
1Sam.4.15	Eli was .xcviij. yeare olde, and hys syght fayled him that he could not se.
1Sam.4.16	And the man sayd vnto Eli: I am he that came out of the araye, Ꟶ fled this daye out of the hoost. And he sayde: what thing is fortuned my sonne?
1Sam.4.17	The messenger answered Ꟶ sayd. Israel is fled before the Philistines, Ꟶ there is a greate slaughter chaunsed amonge the people, Ꟶ thy two sonnes, Hophni Ꟶ Phinehes are deed, Ꟶ the arcke of God is taken.
1Sam.4.18	And it fortuned that whan he made mencion of the arcke of God, Eli fell from of hys stole backwarde vpon the thresholde of the gate, and hys necke brake, and he dyed: for he was an olde man and heuye, and iudged Israel fourtye yeares.
1Sam.4.19	And his daughter in lawe Phinehes wife was wt childe Ꟶ nye the byrthe. And when she hearde the tydinges that the arcke of God was taken, Ꟶ that her father in lawe, Ꟶ her husbande were deed, she bowed her self, and traueled, for her paynes came vpon her.
1Sam.4.20	And about the tyme of her deeth, the wemen that stode aboute her, sayd vnto her: feare not, for thou hast borne a sonne: but she answered not, nor regarded it.
1Sam.4.21	And she named the childe Ichabod, sayinge: The glory is departed from Israel. Because the arcke of God was taken, Ꟶ because of her father in lawe and her husbande.
1Sam.4.22	And she sayde agayne: The glory is gone from Israel, for the arcke of God is taken.
1Sam.5.1	And the Philistynes toke the arcke of God, and caryed it from the helpe stone vnto Asdod,
1Sam.5.2	agayne the Philystynes toke the arcke of God, Ꟶ brought it into the house of Dagon, and sett it by Dagon.
1Sam.5.3	And when they of Asdod were vp in the nexte daye in the mornynge, beholde, Dagon laye vpon the erth before the arcke of the Lorde. And they toke Dagon, Ꟶ set him in hys place agayne.
1Sam.5.4	And when they were vp erly in the nexte mornyng, beholde, Dagon laye vpon the grounde before the arcke of the Lorde, and his heed, Ꟶ his two handes cut of vpon the thresholde, that only the shape of a fyrst was left on hym.
1Sam.5.5	And therfore is it, that the prestes of Dagon (nether any man that commeth into Dagons house) treade not on the thresholde of Dagon in Asdod, vnto thys daye.
1Sam.5.6	But the hande of the Lorde was heuy vpon them of Asdod, Ꟶ he destroyed them, Ꟶ smote them wt emerodes, bothe Asdod Ꟶ in all the coastes therof.
1Sam.5.7	And when the men of Asdod sawe that it was so, they sayde: the arcke of the God of Israel shall not abyde here with vs, for hys hande is sore vpon vs Ꟶ vpon Dagon oure God.
1Sam.5.8	They sent therfore Ꟶ gathered all the lordes of the Philistines vnto them Ꟶ sayde: what shall we do wt the arcke of the God of Israel? They answered: let the arcke of the God of Israel be caryed aboute vnto Gath.
1Sam.5.9	And they caryed the arcke of the God of Israel about. And it fortuned, that when they had caryed it about, there was by the hande of the Lorde a myghtye greate noyse in the cytie, Ꟶ he smote the men of the cytie both small and greate: Ꟶ they had secrete diseases,
1Sam.5.10	Therfore they sent the arcke of God to Akaron. And assone as the arcke of God, came to Akaron, the Akaronites cryed out saying: they haue brought the arcke of the God of Israel to vs, to slee vs and oure people:
1Sam.5.11	And so they sent, and gathered together all the lordes of the Philistines Ꟶ sayde: send awaye the arcke of the God of Israel, to go agayne to his awne place, that it slee vs not and oure people. For there was greate lamentacyon ouer the deade thorowout all the cytie, Ꟶ the hande of God was exceadynge sore there.
1Sam.5.12	And the men that dyed not, were smytten wyth the Emerodes: and the crye of the cytie went vp to heauen.
1Sam.6.1	The arcke of the Lord was in the countrey of the Philistines seuen monethes:
1Sam.6.2	and the Philistynes called for the prestes Ꟶ the soth sayers, sayinge: what shall we do wyth the arcke of the Lorde? tell vs, where with we shall sende it home agayne?
1Sam.6.3	They sayde: Yf you sende the arcke of the God of Israel home agayne, sende it not emptye. But rewarde it wt a trespasse offerynge: and then ye shalbe whole, and it shalbe knowen to you, why hys hande departeth not from you.
1Sam.6.4	Then sayde they: And what shalbe the trespasse offeringe, whych we shall rewarde hym wt? They answered: fyue golden arsses and .v. golden myce, according to the nombre of the lordes of the Philistines. For it is one maner of plage on you all, Ꟶ on your lordes.
1Sam.6.5	Wherfore ye shal make ymages like to your arsses, and ymages lyke to your myce that corrupt the lande, and ye shall geue glory vnto the God of Israel: that he maye take his hand from of you, and from of your goddes, and from of youre lande.
1Sam.6.6	Wherfore do ye harden your hertes as the Egipcians and Pharao hardened their hertes? which when he toke on agaynst them, dyd they not let the people go, Ꟶ they departed?
1Sam.6.7	Now therfore, make a newe carte, and take two melche kyne: on whose necke there hath come no yock. And tye the kyne to the carte, and bring the calues home from them.
1Sam.6.8	And take the arck of the Lord, and laye it vpon the carte, and put the iewels of golde (which ye rewarde him with for a synoffering) in a cofre by the side therof: and send it awaye, that it maye go.
1Sam.6.9	And yf ye se that he go vp by the waye of his awne coaste to Bethsames: then it is he that dyd vs this great euyll. Yf no, we shall knowe then, that it is not his hande that smote vs: but it was a chaunce that happened vs.
1Sam.6.10	And the men dyd euen so: and toke two kyne that gaue mylke, and tyed them to the carte, and kept the calues at home,
1Sam.6.11	and they layde the arck of the Lorde vpon the carte and the cofer wt the myce of gold, and wt the ymages of their arsses.
1Sam.6.12	And the kyne toke the streyght waye to Bethsames, Ꟶ went on the streyght waye: Ꟶ as they went, lowed, Ꟶ turned nether to the right hande ner to the left. And the lordes of the Philistines went after them, vntyll the borders of Bethsames.
1Sam.6.13	And they of Bethsames were reapynge their wheate heruest in the valey. And they lift vp their eyes, and spied the arck. And reioysed when they sawe it.
1Sam.6.14	And the carte came into the felde of one Iehosua a Bethsamite, and stode still there. There was also a great stone. And they claue the wod of the carte Ꟶ offred the kyne a burntoffring vnto the Lord.
1Sam.6.15	And the Leuites toke downe the arck of the Lorde Ꟶ the coffer that was with it, wherin the iewels of golde were: and put them on the great stone. And the men of Bethsames sacrificed burntsacrifice, and offered offeringes that same daye vnto the Lorde.
1Sam.6.16	And when the fyue lordes of the Philistines had sene it, they returned to Akaron the same daye.
1Sam.6.17	And these are the golden arsses which the Philistines gaue to amendes for a trespace offring, to the Lorde: for Asdod one: for Gaza one: for Askalon one: for Gath one: and for Akaron one.
1Sam.6.18	And golden myce, accordyng to the nombre of all the cityes of the Philistines, euen accordynge to the fyue lordes, both of walled townes and of townes vnwalled: euen vnto the greate stone of lamentacyon, wheron they set downe the arcke of the Lord: which stone remaineth vnto this daye in the felde of Iehosua the Bethsamite.
1Sam.6.19	And he plaged the men of Bethsames, because they had sene the arcke of the Lorde. And he slue amonge the people fiftye thousande and thre score and ten men. And the other people lamented, because the Lorde had slayne the people with so great a slaughter.
1Sam.6.20	Wherfore the men of Bethsames sayde: who is able to stande before the Lord so holy a God: and to whom shall he go from vs?
1Sam.6.21	And they sent messengers to the enhabiters of Kariath Iarim, saying: The Philistines haue brought agayne the arke of the Lorde: come ye downe therfore, and fet it vp to you.
1Sam.7.1	And so the men of Kariathiarim came, and fet vp the arck of the Lord: and brought it into the house of Aminadab in Gibea, Ꟶ sanctifyed Eleazar his sonne, to kepe the arck of the Lorde:
1Sam.7.2	and whyle the arcke abode in Kariathiarim, the dayes multiyplied, and ther passed ouer .xx. yeres, and the house of Israel lamented after the Lorde.
1Sam.7.3	And Samuel spake vnto all the house of Israel, saying: yf ye be come agayne vnto the Lorde with all your hertes, then put awaye the straunge goddes and Astharoth from amonge you: and prepare your hertes vnto the Lorde, and serue hym only: for he shall ryd you out of the hande of the Philistines.
1Sam.7.4	Then the chyldren of Israel dyd put awaye Baalim and Astaroth, and serued the Lorde onely.
1Sam.7.5	And Samuel sayde: gather all Israel to Mizpa, and I wyll praye for you vnto the Lorde.
1Sam.7.6	And they gathred together to Mizpa, and drewe water: and powred it out before the Lorde, Ꟶ fasted the same daye and sayde there: we haue synned against the Lorde. And Samuel iudged the chyldren of Israel in Mizpa.
1Sam.7.7	When the Philistines heard that the chyldren of Israel were gathered together to Mizpa, the lordes of the Philistines went vp against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard that they were afrayed of the Philistines,
1Sam.7.8	Ꟶ the children of Israel saide to Samuel: ceasse not to crye vnto the Lorde oure God for vs, that he maye saue vs out of the hand of the Philistines.
1Sam.7.9	And Samuel toke a suckyng lambe, and offered it all together for a burntoffrynge vnto the Lorde: Ꟶ cryed vnto the Lorde for Israel, Ꟶ the Lord heard him.
1Sam.7.10	And as Samuel offred the burntoffring, the Philistines came to fyght agenst Israel. But the Lorde thondered a great thonder that same daye amonge the Philistines, and scatered them, that they fell before Israel.
1Sam.7.11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpa, and pursued the Philistines, Ꟶ folowed vpon them, vntyll the place that is vnder Bethcar.
1Sam.7.12	And then Samuel toke a stone, and pitched it betwene Mizpa and the mark of the rock, and called the name therof, the stone of helpe, saying: Hitherto hath the Lord helped vs.
1Sam.7.13	And so the Philistines were brought vnder, Ꟶ they came nomore into the coastes of Israel: Ꟶ the hand of the Lord was agaynst the Philistines all the dayes of Samuel.
1Sam.7.14	Therto, the cities which the the Philistines had taken from Israel, were restored agayne to Israel, euen from Acaron to Gath, wt the coastes of the same, Ꟶ Israel plucked them out of the handes of the Philistines. And there was peace betwene Israel Ꟶ the Amorites.
1Sam.7.15	Samuel iudged Israel all the dayes of his lyfe,
1Sam.7.16	and went about yere by yere to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpa, Ꟶ iudged Israel in all those places,
1Sam.7.17	Ꟶ came agayne to Rama: for there was his house, Ꟶ ther he iudged Israel also, Ꟶ there he buylt an aulter vnto the Lorde.
1Sam.8.1	When Samuel was olde, he made his sonnes iudges ouer Israel.
1Sam.8.2	The name of his eldest sonne was Ioel, and the name of the second Abia: Ꟶ they were iudges in Beerseba.
1Sam.8.3	And his sonnes walked not in his wayes: but turned asyde after lucre, and toke rewarde, and peruerted the ryght.
1Sam.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered them together, and came to Samuel vnto Rama,
1Sam.8.5	Ꟶ sayd vnto him: behold, thou art olde, and thy sonnes walke not in thy wayes. Now therfore make vs a kinge to iudge vs, as all other nacions haue.
1Sam.8.6	But the thyng displeased Samuel, when they sayde: geue vs a king to iudge vs. And Samuel prayed vnto the Lorde.
1Sam.8.7	And the Lorde sayde vnto Samuel: heare the voyce of the people in all that they saye vnto the. For they haue not cast the awaye, but me: that I shulde not raygne ouer them.
1Sam.8.8	And as they haue euer done (sence I brought them out of Egypte vnto thys daye, and haue forsaken me, and serued other goddes) euen so do they vnto the.
1Sam.8.9	Nowe therfore herken vnto their voyce: howbeit, yet testifye vnto them and shewe them the aucthorite of the king that shall raygne ouer them.
1Sam.8.10	And Samuel told all the wordes of the Lorde vnto the people, that asked a kyng of him, and he sayde:
1Sam.8.11	thys shalbe the aucthorite of the kyng that shal raygne ouer you: he wyll take your sonnes and put them to hys charettes, and make hys horsemen of them, to runne before his charet:
1Sam.8.12	and will make him of them, captaynes ouer thousandes and ouer fiftyes, and wyll set them to eare his grounde, and to gather in his heruest, and to make instrumentes of warre, and apparell for his charettes.
1Sam.8.13	And he wyll take your daughters, Ꟶ make them apoticaries, cookes and bakers.
1Sam.8.14	And he shall take the best of youre feldes, and of youre vyneyardes, and of your olyue trees, and geue them to hys seruauntes.
1Sam.8.15	And he shall take the tenth of your seed, and of your vyneyardes, and geue it to hys chamberlaynes, and to hys seruauntes.
1Sam.8.16	And he shall take the best of your menseruauntes and maydseruauntes and yong men, and of your asses, and put them to his worke.
1Sam.8.17	And he shall take the tenth of youre shepe, and ye shalbe his seruauntes.
1Sam.8.18	And ye shall crie out at that tyme vpon your kynge, which ye shall haue chosen you, Ꟶ the Lorde will not heare you at that daye.
1Sam.8.19	Neuertheles, the people wolde not heare the voyce of Samuel, but dyd say: naye, not so. But there shalbe a king ouer vs,
1Sam.8.20	that we maye be lyke other nacyons, and that oure kyng maye iudge vs, and go out before vs, and fyght our battaylles.
1Sam.8.21	Therfore, when Samuel hearde all the wordes of the people, he rehearsed them in the eares of the Lorde.
1Sam.8.22	And the Lord sayde to Samuel: herken vnto theyr voyce, and make them a king: And Samuel sayde vnto the men of Israel: go euery man vnto his citye.
1Sam.9.1	Ther was a man of BenIamin named Cis the sonne of Abiel, the sonne of zeror, the sonne of Bechorath, the sonne of Aphiah, the sonne of a man that was a Ieminite, a man of strength and might:
1Sam.9.2	and the same had a sonne called Saul, a goodly yong man and a fayre: so that amonge the chyldren of Israel there was none goodlyer then he. For from the shoulders vpwarde, he was hyer then all the other people.
1Sam.9.3	And the asses of thys Cis Sauls father were lost: and Cis sayde to Saul his sonne: take one of the laddes wt the and go vp Ꟶ seke the asses.
1Sam.9.4	And he went thorow mount Ephraim, Ꟶ thorowe the lande of Salisa: but they founde them not. Then they went thorowe the lande of Salim, and there they were not. When they went also thorowe the lande of Iemini, they founde them not.
1Sam.9.5	At the last, when they were come to the land of zuph, Saul saide to his lad that was wt him: come, let vs returne, lest my father leaue caring for the asses, Ꟶ take thought for vs.
1Sam.9.6	He sayd vnto him: behold, there is in this citye a man of God, Ꟶ he is a worshipfull man: all that he sayth, cometh suerly to passe. Nowe then let vs go thyther: peraduenture he shal shewe vs what waye we maye go.
1Sam.9.7	Then sayd Saul to his lad: yf we will go, what shall we bring the man? For our bread is all spent out of oure vessels, Ꟶ there is no nother present to bring the man of God: what haue we?
1Sam.9.8	And the lad answered Saul agayne, and sayde: I haue founde about me the fourth parte of a sycle, that will I geue the man of God, to tell vs oure waye.
1Sam.9.9	Before tyme in Israel when a man went to seke an answere of God, thus wise he spake, come, and let vs go to the sear. For he that is now called a prophet, was in the olde tyme called a sear.
1Sam.9.10	Then sayde Saul to hys lad: well sayde of the: come, let vs go. And so they went vnto the cytie where the man of God was.
1Sam.9.11	And as they were goinge vp into the cytie, they mett wyth damoselles that came out to drawe water, and sayd vnto them: is there here a sear?
1Sam.9.12	And the maydens answered them, yee, beholde, he is before you. Make hast nowe, for he cam thys daye to the cyte for there is an offerynge of the people this daye in the hill.
1Sam.9.13	When ye be come into the cytie, ye shall fynde hym strayght waye, yer he go vp to the hyll to eate: for the people wyll not eate vntyll he come, because he doth blesse the offering. And then eate they that be bydden to the feast. Nowe therfore get you vp, for this daye shall ye fynde hym.
1Sam.9.14	And they went vp into the cytie. And when they were come into the myddes of the citie: beholde, Samuel came out agaynst them, for to go vp to the hill.
1Sam.9.15	But the Lorde had tolde Samuel in his eare (a daye before Saul came) sayenge:
1Sam.9.16	to morowe thys tyme I wyll sende the a man out of the lande of Ben Iamin, hym shalt thou anoynte to be captayne ouer my people Israel, that he maye saue my people out of the hande of the Philistines: for I haue loked vpon my people, and theyr crye is come vnto me.
1Sam.9.17	When Samuel therfore saw Saul, the Lord answered hym: se, this is the man, whom I spake to the of. Thys same shall raygne ouer my people.
1Sam.9.18	Then went Saul to Samuel in the myddle of the gate, Ꟶ sayde: tell me I praye the, where the sears house is.
1Sam.9.19	Samuel answered Saul, and sayde: I am the sear, go vp before me vnto the hill, for ye shall eate wyth me to daye. And to morowe I wyll let the go, and wyll tell the all that is in thyne hert.
1Sam.9.20	And as for thyne asses that were lost thre dayes agoo, care not for them, for they are founde. And moreouer, whose shall the bewtifull thinges of Israel be? belonge they not to the, and vnto all thy fathers house?
1Sam.9.21	But Saul answered and sayde: am not I the sonne of a Ieminite of the smallest trybe of Israel? and my kynred is the least of all the kynredes of the trybe of BenIamin. Wherfore then speakest thou so to me?
1Sam.9.22	And Samuel toke Saul and his lad, and brought them into the parler, and made them sytt in the chefest place amonge them that were bydden: which were vpon a thirtye persones:
1Sam.9.23	And Samuel sayde vnto the cooke: brynge forth the porcyon whych I gaue the, and of which I sayd vnto the: kepe it with the.
1Sam.9.24	And the cooke toke vp the shoulder, Ꟶ that whych was vpon it, Ꟶ set it before Saul. And Samuel sayd: beholde, that which is left: put it before the Ꟶ eate, for hitherto hath it bene kept for the, of purpose, when I called the people. And so Saul dyd eat with Samuel that daye.
1Sam.9.25	And when they were come downe from the hyll into the cytie, Samuel comuned wyth Saul vpon the toppe of the house
1Sam.9.26	and whan they arose erlye about the sprynge of the daye, Samuel called Saul vpon the toppe of the house, sayenge: vp, that I maye sende the awaye. And Saul arose. And they went out at the dores both, he Ꟶ Samuel.
1Sam.9.27	And when they were come almost out of the towne, Samuel sayd to Saul: byd the lad go before vs (and he went before) but stande thou styll a whyle, that I maye shewe the what God sayeth.
1Sam.10.1	And then Samuel toke a vessell of oyle, Ꟶ powred it vpon hys heed, Ꟶ kyssed him, Ꟶ sayde: hath not the Lord anoynted the, to be captayne ouer hys enheritaunce?
1Sam.10.2	When thou art departed from me this daye, thou shalt fynde two men by Rahels sepulcre in the border of BenIamin, euen at zalezah. And they will saye vnto the: the asses which thou wentest to seke, are founde. And lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, Ꟶ soroweth for you, sayenge: what shall I do for my sonne?
1Sam.10.3	Then shalt thou go forth from thence, Ꟶ shalt come to the playne of Thabor. And there shall mete the thre men goinge vp, to God to Bethel: one caryeng thre kiddes: Ꟶ another caryeng thre loues of breed: Ꟶ another caryeng a botell of wyne.
1Sam.10.4	And they wyll salute the, Ꟶ geue the two loues of breed: which thou shalt receaue of theyr handes.
1Sam.10.5	After that shalt thou come to the hyll of God, where the Philistines kepe their watche. And when thou art come thyther to the cytie, thou shalt mete a companye of prophetes comminge downe from the hill, wt a psalter, a tymbrell, a pype, Ꟶ a harpe before them, Ꟶ they shall prophesye.
1Sam.10.6	And the sprete of the Lorde wyll come vpon the also, Ꟶ thou shalt prophesye, with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
1Sam.10.7	Therfore when these signes are chaunced the, do what thou hast to do, for God is wyth the.
1Sam.10.8	And thou shalt go before me to Gilgal. And I also wyll come downe vnto the, to sacrifye burntsacrifyces, and to offre peace offerynges Tary for me seuen dayes, tyll I come to the, and shew the, what thou shalt do.
1Sam.10.9	And assone as he had turned hys shoulder to go from Samuel, God gaue hym another maner of herte, Ꟶ all those tokens came to passe that same daye.
1Sam.10.10	And when they came to the hill: beholde, the companye of prophetes met hym, and the sprete of God cam vpon hym also, Ꟶ he prophesyed among them.
1Sam.10.11	And all that knewe hym before, when they sawe that he prophesyed amonge the prophetes, they sayd eche to other: what is this that is happened vnto the sonne of Cis? Is Saul also amonge the prophetes?
1Sam.10.12	And one of the same place answered Ꟶ sayde: who is their father? And therof came the prouerbe: what, is Saul also amonge the prophetes?
1Sam.10.13	And when he had made an ende of prophesyeng, he cam to the hill.
1Sam.10.14	And Saules fathers brother sayde vnto hym and to hys lad: whether went ye? He sayde: to seke the asses: Ꟶ when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.
1Sam.10.15	And Sauls vncle sayde: tell me what Samuel sayde vnto you?
1Sam.10.16	Saul answered his vncle: he tolde vs planely, that the asses were founde. But of the kyngdome wherof Samuel spake, tolde he hym not.
1Sam.10.17	And Samuel called the people together vnto the Lorde to Mizpa,
1Sam.10.18	and sayde vnto the chyldren of Israel: thus sayth the Lorde God of Israel: I brought Israel out of Egypt, and delyuered you out of the hande of the Egypcyans, Ꟶ out of the handes of all kyngdomes that troubled you.
1Sam.10.19	And ye haue this daye cast awaye youre God that helped you out of all youre aduersyties Ꟶ tribulacyons. And ye haue sayd vnto hym: make a kynge ouer vs. Nowe therfore stande ye before the Lorde by youre trybes Ꟶ youre thousandes.
1Sam.10.20	And whan Samuel had brought all the tribes of Israel, the tribe of BenIamin was caught.
1Sam.10.21	When he had brought the tribe of BenIamin by their kynredes, the kynred of Matri was caught: and at the last Saul the sonne of Cis was caught. And whan they sought hym, he coulde not be founde.
1Sam.10.22	Therfore they asked the Lorde further, yf the man shulde come thither. And the Lorde answered: beholde, he hath hydd hym selfe amonge the stuffe.
1Sam.10.23	And they ranne Ꟶ fet him thence. And when he stode amonge the people, he was hyer then any of the people, from the shoulders vpwarde.
1Sam.10.24	And Samuel sayde to all the people: Se ye not him, whom the Lorde hath chosen, Ꟶ howe there is none lyke hym amonge all the people? And all the people showted Ꟶ sayde: God lend the kynge lyfe.
1Sam.10.25	Then Samuel tolde the people the dutye of the kyngdome, Ꟶ wrote it in a boke, and layde it vp before the Lorde, and sent all the people awaye, euery man to hys house.
1Sam.10.26	And Saul also went home to Gibea. And there folowed him strong men, whose hertes God had touched.
1Sam.10.27	But the chyldren of Belial sayde: howe shall he saue vs? and they despised him, and brought him no presentes. And he helde is tonge.
1Sam.11.1	Nahas the Ammonite came, and beseged Iabes in Gilead. And all the men of Iabes sayde vnto Nahas: make a couenaunt wyth vs, and we wylbe thy seruauntes:
1Sam.11.2	And Nahas the Ammonite answered them: In thys will I make a couenaunt wyth you, yf I maye thrust out all youre ryght eyes, and brynge that shame vpon all Israel.
1Sam.11.3	To whom the elders of Iabes sayd: geue vs seuen dayes respite: that we maye sende messengers vnto all the coastes of Israel. And then yf there be no man to helpe vs, we wyll come out to the.
1Sam.11.4	Then came the messengers to Gibea vnto Saul, and tolde thys tydynges in the eares of the people. And all the people lyfte vp theyr voyces and wept.
1Sam.11.5	And beholde, Saul came folowynge the catell out of the felde, Ꟶ Saul sayde: what ayleth thys people, that they wepe? And they tolde hym the tydynges of the men of Iabes.
1Sam.11.6	And the sprete of God came vpon Saul, when he heard those tydinges, and he was excedyng angrye,
1Sam.11.7	and toke a yocke of oxen, and hewed them in peces, Ꟶ sent them thorowe out all the coastes of Israel by the handes of messengers, sayeng: whosoeuer commeth not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall hys oxen be serued. And the feare of the Lorde fell on the people, and they cam out as it had bene but one man.
1Sam.11.8	And when he nombred them in Bezek, the chyldren of Israel were thre hundred thousande men, and the men of Iuda thirtye thousande.
1Sam.11.9	And they sayde vnto the messengers that cam: so saye vnto the men of Iabes in Gilead: to morow by that tyme the sonne be hote, ye shal haue helpe. And the messengers cam Ꟶ shewed the men of Iabes, which were glad.
1Sam.11.10	Therfore the men of Iabes sayde: tomorowe we wyll come out vnto you, and ye shall do wyth vs all that pleaseth you.
1Sam.11.11	And on the morowe it fortuned, that Saul put the people in .iij. partes. And they cam in vpon the host in the mornyng watche, Ꟶ slue the Ammonites, vntyll the heat of the daye. And they that remayned, were skattered: so that two of them were not left together.
1Sam.11.12	And the people sayde vnto Samuel: what is he that darre saye: shall Saul raygne ouer vs? brynge those men, that we maye slaye them.
1Sam.11.13	And Saul sayde: there shall no man dye thys daye, for to daye the Lord hathe saued Israel.
1Sam.11.14	Then sayde Samuel vnto the people: come, that we maye go to Gilgal, and renewe the kyngdome there.
1Sam.11.15	And all the people went to Gilgal, Ꟶ made Saul kyng there, before the Lorde in Gilgal. And there they offered peaceofferynges before the Lorde. And there Saul and all the men of Israel reioysed excedyngly.
1Sam.12.1	Samuel sayd vnto all Israel: beholde, I haue herkened vnto your voyce in all that ye sayde vnto me, Ꟶ haue made you a kynge.
1Sam.12.2	Nowe therfore, youre kynge walketh before you. And I am olde and graye headed: and behold, my sonnes are with you, and I haue walked before you from my childehode vnto thys daye.
1Sam.12.3	Beholde, here I am: beare recorde of me before the Lorde and before hys anoynted: Whose oxe haue I taken? or whose Asse haue I taken? whom haue I done wrong to? Whom haue I hurt? Or of whose hande haue I receaued any brybe, to blynde myne eyes therwyth? Ꟶ I wyll restore it you agayne.
1Sam.12.4	They sayde: thou hast done vs no wronge, nor hurt vs, nether hast thou taken ought of any mannes hande.
1Sam.12.5	He sayde vnto them agayne: the Lord is witnesse agaynst you, Ꟶ hys anoynted is wytnesse thys daye, that ye haue founde naught in my handes. And they answered: he is wytnesse.
1Sam.12.6	And Samuel sayd vnto the people: it is the Lorde, that made Moses Ꟶ Aaron, Ꟶ that brought youre fathers out of the lande of Egypte.
1Sam.12.7	Nowe therfore stande still, that I maye reason wt you before the Lorde, accordyng to all the ryghtousnesses of the Lord, which he shewed both you and youre fathers.
1Sam.12.8	After that Iacob was come into Egypte, and youre fathers cryed vnto the Lorde the Lorde sent Moses Ꟶ Aaron, which brought your fathers out of Egipt, Ꟶ made them dwell in this place.
1Sam.12.9	And whan they forgat the lord their God, he delyuered them into the hand of Sisara captaine of the hoost of Hazor and into the hande of the Philistynes, and into the hande of the kynge of Moab, and they fought agaynst them.
1Sam.12.10	And they cryed vnto the Lorde, Ꟶ sayde: we haue synned, because we haue forsaken the Lorde, and haue serued Baalim and Astharoth. Nowe therfore delyuer vs out of the handes of oure enemyes and we wyll serue the.
1Sam.12.11	And the Lorde sent Ierobaal Badan Iephthah, Ꟶ Samuel, and delyuered you out of the handes of youre enemyes on euery syde, and ye dwelled safe.
1Sam.12.12	And for all that, when you sawe that Nahas the kyng of the chyldren of Ammon cam agaynst you, ye sayde vnto me: not so but a kyng shall raigne ouer vs, when yet the Lorde youre God was youre kynge.
1Sam.12.13	Nowe therfore, beholde, the kinge whom ye haue chosen, and whom ye haue desyred: lo, the Lord hath set a kynge ouer you.
1Sam.12.14	Yf ye wyll feare the Lorde Ꟶ serue hym, and heare hys voyce, Ꟶ not disobeye the worde of the Lorde: both ye Ꟶ the kynge that raygneth ouer you, shall folowe the Lorde youre God:
1Sam.12.15	Yf ye wyll not herken vnto the voyce of the Lord, but disobeye the Lordes mouth: then shall the hande of the Lorde be vpon you and on youre fathers.
1Sam.12.16	Nowe also stande, and se thys great thynge, whych the Lord will do before your eyes:
1Sam.12.17	is it not now wheatheruest? I will call vnto the Lorde, and he shall sende thunder and rayne: that ye maye perceaue and se, howe that youre wickednes is great, which ye haue done in the syght of the Lorde, in askynge you a kynge.
1Sam.12.18	And so, Samuel called vnto the Lorde, and the Lorde sent thunder and rayne the same daye. And all the people feared the Lorde and Samuel exceadyngly.
1Sam.12.19	And all the people sayde vnto Samuel: praye for thy seruauntes vnto the Lord thy God, that we dye not: for we haue synned in askynge vs a kynge, besyde all the synnes that euer we dyd.
1Sam.12.20	And Samuel sayde vnto the people: feare not. Ye haue in dede done all thys wyckednesse, yet departe not from folowynge of the Lorde. But serue hym euen wyth all youre hertes.
1Sam.12.21	Nether turne ye after vayne thinges whych are not able to profyt you, for they are but vanitye.
1Sam.12.22	For the Lorde wyll not forsake hys people, because of hys great names sake: because it hath pleased the Lord, to make you his people.
1Sam.12.23	Moreouer God forbydde, that I shulde synne agaynst the Lorde, and ceasse prayeng for you, but to shewe you the good Ꟶ ryght waye.
1Sam.12.24	Therfore feare you the Lorde, and serue hym in the trueth, and wyth all youre hertes Ꟶ consydre howe great thinges he hath done for you.
1Sam.12.25	But and yf ye do wyckedlye, then shall ye peryshe, both ye and youre kynge.
1Sam.13.1	Saul had bene kynge one yere (whan these thynges came to passe) and he raygned two yeares ouer Israel.
1Sam.13.2	And Saul chose him thre thousand men of Israel. Two thousande were wyth Saul in Michmas and in mount Bethel, Ꟶ a thousande wyth Ionathas in Gibea BenIamin. And the rest of the people he sent, euery man to hys awne house agayne.
1Sam.13.3	And Ionathas smote the holde of the Philystines, that was in the hyll, and it came to the Philistines eares. And Saul blewe the trompet thorowe out all the lande, sayenge: let the Ebrues heare.
1Sam.13.4	And all Israel hearde saye, howe that Saul had destroyed an holde of the Philystines, wherfore Israel stancke before the Philystines. And the people gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.
1Sam.13.5	The Philistines also geathered them selues togeather to fyght wyth Israel, thirtye thousand charettes and syxe thousand horse men, with other people lyke the sand by the sees syde in multitude, and came vp, and pitched in Michmas eastwarde from Bethauen.
1Sam.13.6	And when the men of Israel sawe it, they were in a strayte, Ꟶ feare came vpon the people, and they hydd them selues in caues, and in preuy holes, and in rockes, and in hye places, Ꟶ in pittes.
1Sam.13.7	And some of the Ebrues went ouer Iordan to go vnto the lande of Gad Ꟶ Gilead. And Saul was yet in Gilgal, Ꟶ all the people that folowed him were astonyed.
1Sam.13.8	And he taryed seuen dayes, euen vnto the tyme that Samuel had appoynted. But Samuel came not to Gilgal, Ꟶ the people were therfore skatered from him.
1Sam.13.9	And Saul sayd: bring a burntsacrifyce to me Ꟶ peace offringes. And he offered burnt sacrifyce.
1Sam.13.10	And as sone as he had made an ende of offerynge the burntsacrifyce, beholde, Samuel cam. And Saul went agaynst him, to blesse him.
1Sam.13.11	And Samuel sayde. what hast thou done? Saul sayde: because I saw that the people skatered from me, and that thou camest not wtin the dayes apoynted, and that the Philistines geathered them selues togeather to Michmas:
1Sam.13.12	therfore sayd I: the Philistines shall come downe nowe vpon me to Gilgal, Ꟶ I haue not made supplicacion vnto the Lord. And whan I had ouercome my selfe, at the last I offered a burntofferynge.
1Sam.13.13	And Samuel sayde to Saul thou art become a fole, thou hast not kept the commaundment of the Lord thy God, which he commaunded the. For at this tyme wold the Lord haue stablysshed thy kingdome vpon Israel for euer,
1Sam.13.14	But nowe, thy kyngdome shall not continewe. The Lorde hath sought him a man after his awne hart, Ꟶ the Lord hath commaunded him to be captayne ouer his people: because thou hast not kept that whych the Lorde commaunded the.
1Sam.13.15	And Samuel arose Ꟶ gat hym vp from Gilgal to Gibea BenIamin. And Saul nombred the people that were founde wt him, Ꟶ they were about a syxe hundred men.
1Sam.13.16	And Saul and Ionathas his sonne and the people that were founde wyth them, had theyr abydynge in the hyll of BenIamin. But the Philistines pitched in Michmas.
1Sam.13.17	And there came out of the host of the Philistines thre companies, to destroye: one companye turned vnto the waye that leadeth to Ophra vnto the lande of Saul.
1Sam.13.18	And a nother companye turned the waye to Bethoron. And the thryde company turned to the waye of the cost that is sene aboue the valeye of zeboim towarde the wyldernesse.
1Sam.13.19	There was no smyth founde thorowe out all the lande of Israel. For the Philistines sayde: Lest happly the Ebrues make them swerdes or speres.
1Sam.13.20	But all the Israelites went downe to the Philistynes, to mende euerye man his share, his mattock, his axe Ꟶ his necessary toles:
1Sam.13.21	And then the edges of the shares, mattockes, donge forkes, and axes were blunt, and also the forkes were to be set in.
1Sam.13.22	And so in tyme of battell there was nether swerde nor spere founde in the handes of any of the people that were wyth Saul and Ionathas. But with Saul and Ionathas hys sonne was there somwhat founde.
1Sam.13.23	And the watch of the Philistines came out, to go ouer vnto Michmas.
1Sam.14.1	And it fortuned the same tyme, that Ionathas the sonne of Saul sayd vnto hys younge man that bare hys harnes: come, and let vs go ouer to the Philistines watche that are younder on the other syde, and he tolde not his father.
1Sam.14.2	And Saul taryed in the vttmost parte of Gibea vnder Rimmon, whych is in Migron, Ꟶ the people that were wyth him were vpon a syxe hundred men.
1Sam.14.3	And Ahia the sonne of Ahitob Iehabods brother, the sonne of Phinehes, the sonne of Eli, was the Lordes preaste in Silo, Ꟶ ware an Ephod. And the people wyst not that Ionathas was gone.
1Sam.14.4	And in the myddes of the passage (by which Ionathas sought to go ouer vnto the Philistines watch) were there two sharpe rockes euen one on the one syde, Ꟶ the other on the other syde: the one called Bozez, Ꟶ the other Senne.
1Sam.14.5	The forefront of the one, leaned northwarde towarde Michmas, Ꟶ the other was southwarde, towarde Gibea:
1Sam.14.6	And Ionathas sayd to the younge man that bare his harnesse: come and let vs go ouer vnto the watch of these vncircumcised, paraduenture the Lorde will worke wt vs: for it is no hardnesse wt the Lord to saue ether in manye or in fewe.
1Sam.14.7	And his harnesberar sayde vnto him: do all that is in thyne hert: Go where it pleaseth the: Behold, I am wt the, as thine hert lusteth.
1Sam.14.8	Then sayde Ionathas: beholde, we go ouer vnto these men, Ꟶ shall shew oure selues vnto them:
1Sam.14.9	yf they saye on this wise to vs: tarye, vntill we come to you, then we will stande stil in or place, Ꟶ not go vp vnto them.
1Sam.14.10	But Ꟶ yf they saye: come vp vnto vs, then we will go vp, for the Lorde hath delyuered them into oure handes And thys shalbe a sygne vnto vs.
1Sam.14.11	And they bothe shewed them selues vnto the watch of the Philistines. And the Philistines sayde: se, the Hebrues come out of the holes where they had hydd them selues in.
1Sam.14.12	And the men of the watche answered Ionathas and his harnesbearer, Ꟶ sayde, come vp to vs, and we will shew you a thinge. And Ionathas sayde vnto his harnesbearer, come vp after me, for the Lord hath delyuered them into the hande of Israel.
1Sam.14.13	And Ionathas clame vp vpon handes Ꟶ fete, Ꟶ his harnesberer after him. And they fell before Ionathas: Ꟶ his harnesberer slue them after hym.
1Sam.14.14	And that first slaughter which Ionathas and his harnesberer made, was vpon a twentie men, within the compasse as it were about an halfe aker of lande.
1Sam.14.15	And ther was a feare in the host, in the felde, Ꟶ amonge all people: in so moche that they that were gone out of the watche to robbe, were afrayde also: and the erth trymbled, for the feare that was sent of God.
1Sam.14.16	And the watche men of Saul in Gibea Ben Iamin, sawe. And beholde, the people (of the Philistines) were skatered Ꟶ were smytten as they went.
1Sam.14.17	Then sayde Saul vnto the people that was with him. Searche and se, who is gone awaye from vs. And when they had nombred, beholde, Ionathas Ꟶ hys harnesbearer were not there.
1Sam.14.18	And Saul sayde vnto Ahia: bringe hither the arcke of God. For the arcke of God was at that tyme wyth the chyldren of Israel.
1Sam.14.19	And it fortuned that while Saul talked vnto the preaste, the noyse that was in the hoste of the Philistines spred farther abrode, Ꟶ increased. And Saul sayde vnto the preaste: wt drawe thyne handes.
1Sam.14.20	And Saul ioyned hymselfe vnto all the people that were with him, Ꟶ they came to the battell. And beholde euery mannes swerde was agaynst his felowe, and there was a very greate rumore.
1Sam.14.21	Moreouer, the Ebrues that were wyth the Philistines before that tyme, and were come with them in all partes of the hoste, turned, to be with the Israelites that were wyth Saul Ꟶ Ionathas.
1Sam.14.22	And all the men of Israel also, which had hidd them selues in mount Ephraim, as sone as they hearde howe that the Philistines were fledd, they folowed after them in the battell.
1Sam.14.23	And so God holpe Israel that daye. And the battell continued vnto Bethauen.
1Sam.14.24	And whyle the men of Israel were kepte downe wyth honger that daye, Saul charged the people with an ooth sayinge: Cursed be the man that eateth any foode vntyll nyght, tyll I be aduenged of myne enemyes: And so, none of the people tasted any sustinaunce.
1Sam.14.25	And all the inhabiters of the lande came to a wood where honye laye vpon the grounde.
1Sam.14.26	And the people came into the wood: And beholde, the honye dropped, and no man moued hys hande to his mouth, for the people feared the ooth.
1Sam.14.27	But Ionathas hearde not when hys father charged the people with the ooth, wherfore he put forth the ende of the rodd that was in his hande, and dipt it in an honye combe, Ꟶ put his hande to his mouth, and his eyes receaued syght.
1Sam.14.28	Then answered one of the people and sayde: thy father adiured the people, sayinge: Cursed be the man that eateth any sustinaunce this daye, Ꟶ the people were fayntye.
1Sam.14.29	Then sayde Ionathas: my father hath troubled the lande: se howe myne eyes hath receaued syght, because I tasted a lytle of this honye:
1Sam.14.30	howe much more then to daye yf the people had eaten of the spoyle of their enemyes whych they founde. And had there not bene then a moche greater slaughter amonge the Philistines?
1Sam.14.31	And they layed on the Philistines that daye, from Michmas to Atalon. And the people were excedinge fayntie.
1Sam.14.32	And the people gat them to the spoyle, Ꟶ toke shepe, oxen, Ꟶ calues, Ꟶ slue them on the grounde, Ꟶ the people dyd eate them wt the bloude.
1Sam.14.33	Then men tolde Saul, sayinge: Beholde, the people synne agaynst the Lord, in that they eate with the bloude. And he sayde: ye haue trespaced. Rowle a great stone vnto me this daye,
1Sam.14.34	and Saul sayde agayne: Go abroade amonge the people Ꟶ bydd them brynge me euery man his oxe Ꟶ euery man his shepe, and slaye them here, and synne not agaynst the Lorde in eatynge wt the bloude. And the people brought euery man hys oxe in his hande, by nyght, Ꟶ slue them there.
1Sam.14.35	And Saul made an altare vnto the Lorde. And that was the fyrst altare that he made vnto the Lorde.
1Sam.14.36	And Saul sayde: lett vs go downe after the Philistines by nyght and spoyle them, vntyll it be daye in the mornynge, Ꟶ lett vs not leaue one man of them. And they sayd: do whatsoeuer thou thinkest best. Then sayde the preast: lett vs come hither vnto God.
1Sam.14.37	And Saul asked of God: shall I go downe after the Philistines? Wilt thou delyuer them into the handes of Israel? But he answered him not at that tyme.
1Sam.14.38	And Saul sayde: let the people come hyther out of all quarters, and knowe Ꟶ se by whom thys synne is chaunced this daye:
1Sam.14.39	for as truly as the Lorde lyueth which saueth Israel, though it be in Ionathas my sonne, he shall dye the death. But there was no man amonge all the people that answered him.
1Sam.14.40	Then he sayde vnto all Israel: be ye on one syde, and I Ꟶ Ionathas my sonne wilbe on the other syde. And the people sayde vnto Saul: what thou thynkest best, that do.
1Sam.14.41	Therfore Saul sayde vnto the Lorde God of Israel: geue a perfect lott. And Saul Ꟶ Ionathas were caught, but the people skaped free.
1Sam.14.42	And Saul sayde, cast lottes betwene me Ꟶ Ionathas my sonne. And Ionathas was caught.
1Sam.14.43	Then Saul sayde to Ionathas: tell me what thou hast done. And Ionathas tolde him, Ꟶ sayde. I tasted a lytle honye with the ende of the rodd that was in myne hande: and lo, I must dye.
1Sam.14.44	Saul answered: God do so and so to me, thou shalt dye the death Ionathas.
1Sam.14.45	And the people sayde vnto Saul: shall Ionathas dye, which hath so myghtelye helped Israel? God forbyd. As truly as the Lorde lyueth there shall not one heere of hys heed fall to the grounde: for he hath wrought with God thys daye. And so the people delyuered Ionathas, that he dyed not.
1Sam.14.46	And then Saul departed vp from folowinge the Philistines. And the Philistines went to their awne place.
1Sam.14.47	And so Saul helde the kyngdome ouer Israel, Ꟶ fought agaynst all his enemyes on euery syde: agaynst Moab: agaynst the chyldren of Ammon: agaynst Edom: agaynst the kynges of zoba, and agaynst the Philistines. And whether so euer he turned him selfe, there he wanne:
1Sam.14.48	and he gathered his host together, and smote the Amaleckites, Ꟶ rydd Israel out of the handes of them that spoyled them.
1Sam.14.49	The sonnes of Saul were: Ionathas, Iesui, and Melchisua. And hys two daughters were thus named: the elder was called Merob, and the younger Michol.
1Sam.14.50	And the name of Saules wife, was Ahinoa the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of hys chefe captayne was Abner the sonne of Ner, Saules vncle.
1Sam.14.51	And Cis was Sauls father. And Ner the father of Abner was the sonne of Abiel.
1Sam.14.52	And there was sore warre agaynst the Philistines, all the dayes of Saul. And whomsoeuer Saul sawe to be a stronge man, and mete for the warre he toke him vnto him.
1Sam.15.1	Samuel sayde vnto Saul: the Lord sent me to anoynt the, to be kynge ouer his people Israel. Nowe therfore herken thou vnto the voyce of the wordes of the Lorde.
1Sam.15.2	Thus sayth the Lorde of hostes: I remembre that whych Amaleck dyd to Israel howe they layed wayte for them in the waye, as they came out of Egypte.
1Sam.15.3	Nowe therfore go, Ꟶ smyte Amaleck, and destroye ye all that pertayneth vnto them, Ꟶ se thou haue no compassyon on them slaye both man Ꟶ woman, infant Ꟶ sucklynge. oxe, and shepe, camell and Asse.
1Sam.15.4	And Saul gathered the people together, Ꟶ nombred them in Telaim, two hundred thousande foote men, and ten thousande men of Iuda.
1Sam.15.5	And Saul came vnto a cytie of Amaleck, Ꟶ set watche in the valeye.
1Sam.15.6	And Saul sayde vnto the kenites: go, Ꟶ departe, Ꟶ gett you downe from amonge the Amaleckites, lest I destroye you with them: for ye shewed mercy to all the children of Israell, when they came out of Egypt. And so the kenites departed from amonge the Amaleckites.
1Sam.15.7	And Saul smote the Amaleckites from Heuila, as thou commest to Sur, that lyeth before Egypt,
1Sam.15.8	and toke Agag the kinge of the Amaleckites alyue, Ꟶ vtterlye destroyed all the people with the edge of the swerde.
1Sam.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the better shepe, Ꟶ the fatter oxen, Ꟶ the lambes, and all that was good, Ꟶ wolde not destroye them. But all that was foule Ꟶ naught worth, that they destroyed vtterlye.
1Sam.15.10	Then came the worde of the Lorde vnto Samuel, sayinge:
1Sam.15.11	it repenteth me, that I haue made Saul kynge. For he is turned from me, and hath not parfourmed my commaundementes. And Samuel was euell apayed, and cried vnto the Lorde all nyght.
1Sam.15.12	And whan Samuel rose erlye, to mete Saul in the mornynge, it was tolde Samuel, that Saul was come to Carmel, Ꟶ beholde, he hath made him there a place, Ꟶ is turned, and departed, and gone downe to Gilgall.
1Sam.15.13	And Samuel came to Saul, Ꟶ Saul sayde vnto him: Blessed be thou in the Lorde. I haue fulfylled the commaundement of the Lord.
1Sam.15.14	Samuel sayde: what meaneth then the bleatyng of the shepe in myne eares, and the noyse of the oxen which I heare?
1Sam.15.15	Saul answered: they haue brought them from the Amaleckites. For the people spared the best of the shepe and of the oxen, to sacrifyce them vnto the Lorde thy God. And the remnaunt haue we destroyed vtterly.
1Sam.15.16	Samuel sayde to Saul: lett me tell the what the Lorde hath sayde to me this nyght. And he sayde vnto hym: saye on.
1Sam.15.17	Samuel sayde when thou wast lytle in thyne awne syght, wast thou not made the heed of the trybes of Israel? And the Lorde anoynted the kyng ouer Israel.
1Sam.15.18	And the Lorde sent the on a iourneye, Ꟶ sayde: Go, Ꟶ vtterlye destroye those synners the Amaleckites, and fyght agaynst them, vntill thou vtterlye destroye them.
1Sam.15.19	And wherfore hast thou not herkened vnto the voyce of the Lorde, but hast turned to the praye, and hast done that whych is wycked in the syght of the Lorde?
1Sam.15.20	And Saul sayde vnto Samuel: yee, I haue harkened vnto the voyce of the Lorde, Ꟶ haue gone the waye which the Lorde sent me vnto, and haue brought Agag the kyng of Amaleck, and haue vtterlye destroyed the Amaleckites,
1Sam.15.21	But the people toke of the spoyle shepe, oxen, and the chefest of the thynges whych shulde haue bene destroyed, to offer vnto the Lorde thy God in Gilgall.
1Sam.15.22	And Samuel sayde: hath the Lorde as great pleasure in burnt sacrifyces Ꟶ offeringes, as whan the voyce of the Lord is obeyed? Behold, to obeye is better then sacrifyce, Ꟶ to herken, is better then the fatt of rammes.
1Sam.15.23	For rebellyon is as the synne of witchcrafte, and stoburnesse is as the wickednesse of Idolatrie. Because thou hast cast awaye the worde of the Lorde, therfore hath the Lorde cast awaye the also, from beynge kynge.
1Sam.15.24	And Saul sayde vnto Samuel: I haue synned, for I haue gone farther then the sayinge of the Lorde and thy wordes, because I feared the people, Ꟶ obeyed their voyce.
1Sam.15.25	Nowe therfore take awaye my synne, and turne agayne with me, that I maye worshyp the Lord
1Sam.15.26	And Samuel sayde vnto Saul: I wyll not returne with the: for thou hast cast awaye the worde of the Lorde, and the Lorde hath cast awaye the, that thou shalt not be kynge ouer Israel.
1Sam.15.27	And as Samuel turned hym selfe to go awaye, he caught the lappe of hys coate, Ꟶ it rent.
1Sam.15.28	And Samuel sayde vnto hym: the Lorde hath rent the kyngdome of Israel from the this daye, Ꟶ hath geuen it to a neyghboure of thyne, that is better then thou.
1Sam.15.29	The strength of Israel wyll not begyle nor repent: for he is not a man, that can repent.
1Sam.15.30	He sayde: I haue synned. But nowe honoure me before the elders of my people, and before Israel, Ꟶ turne agayne with me, that I maye worshippe the Lorde thy God.
1Sam.15.31	And so Samuel turned agayne, and folowed Saul. And Saul worshipped the Lorde.
1Sam.15.32	Then sayde Samuel: Brynge ye hither to me, Agag the kynge of the Amaleckites. And Agag came vnto hym delycately. And Agag sayde: truly the bytter deeth cometh on.
1Sam.15.33	And Samuel sayde: As thy swerde hath made wemen chyldelesse, so shall thy mother be chyldelesse aboue other wemen. And Samuel hewed Agag in peces before the Lorde in Gilgal.
1Sam.15.34	And then Samuel departed to Rama. And Saul went home to his house to Gibea Saul.
1Sam.15.35	And Samuel came nomore to se Saul vntill the daye of his deeth. Neuerthelesse Samuel mourned for Saul, Ꟶ the Lord repented, that he had made Saul kynge ouer Israel.
1Sam.16.1	The Lorde sayde vnto Samuel: Howe longe wylt thou mourne for Saul, seynge I haue cast hym awaye from raygnynge ouer Israel? Fyll thyne horne with oyntment, and come, that I maye sende the to Isai the Bethlehemite, for I haue prouided me a kynge amonge hys sonnes.
1Sam.16.2	And Samuel sayd: howe can I goo? For yf Saul heare it, he will kyll me. The Lorde answered: Take an heifer wt the, and saye: I am come to offer to the Lorde.
1Sam.16.3	And call Isai to the offerynge, and I wyll shewe the, what thou shalt do: And thou shalt anoynt hym whom I name vnto the.
1Sam.16.4	And so Samuel dyd as the Lorde bad him, and came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the towne were astonnied at his commyng, and sayde: Commest thou peaceably?
1Sam.16.5	He answered: Yee, I am come to offer vnto the Lorde. Sanctifye youre selues, Ꟶ come with me to the offerynge. And he sanctifyed Isai Ꟶ his sonnes, Ꟶ bad them to the offerynge.
1Sam.16.6	And when they were come, he loked on Eliab, Ꟶ sayde: Surely the Lordes anoynted is before hym.
1Sam.16.7	But the Lorde sayde vnto Samuel: loke not on his fashyon, or on the heyght of hys stature, because I haue refused hym: for God seyth not as man seyth. For man loketh on the outwarde apperaunce but God beholdeth the harte.
1Sam.16.8	Then Isai called Abinadab, and made him come before Samuel. And he sayde: nether hath the Lorde chosen thys.
1Sam.16.9	Then Isai made Samma come, and he sayde: nether yet hath the Lorde chosen him.
1Sam.16.10	Agayne, Isai made seuen of his sonnes to come before Samuel. And Samuel sayde vnto Isai: the Lorde hath chosen none of these.
1Sam.16.11	And Samuel sayde vnto Isai: are here all thy chyldren? He sayde: there is yet a lytle one behynde, that kepeth the shepe. And Samuel sayd vnto Isai: sende and fette him, for we will not sytte downe, tyll he be come hyther.
1Sam.16.12	And he sent, Ꟶ brought hym in. And he was browne, and of an excellent bewtye, Ꟶ well fauored in syght. And the Lorde sayde: Aryse, and anoynt him, for this is he.
1Sam.16.13	Therfore Samuel toke the horne wyth the oyntment, Ꟶ anoynted him in the myddes of hys brethren. And the sprete of the Lorde came vpon Dauid, from that daye forwarde. And Samuel rose vp, and went to Rama.
1Sam.16.14	But the sprete of the Lorde departed from Saul, and an euell sprete sent of the Lorde vexed him.
1Sam.16.15	And Sauls seruauntes sayde vnto him: Beholde, an euell sprete sent of God vexed the,
1Sam.16.16	lett oure Lord therfore commaunde his seruauntes (that are before the) to seke a man, that is a connynge player wyth an harpe: that when the euell sprete sent of God commeth vpon the, he maye playe with hys hande and thou shalt be eased.
1Sam.16.17	Saul sayde vnto his seruauntes: prouide me a man then that can playe well, and bringe him to me.
1Sam.16.18	Then answered one of his seruauntes and sayde: Beholde, I haue sene a sonne of Isai the Bethlehemite, that can playe vpon instrumentes, and is an actiue felowe, and a man of warre and prudent in doynge of feates, Ꟶ well made and the Lorde is with hym.
1Sam.16.19	Wherfore Saul sent messengers vnto Isai, and sayde: sende me Dauid thy sonne, which is wyth the shepe.
1Sam.16.20	And Isai toke an asse laden with breed, and a flacket of wyne, and a kyd, and sent them by Dauid his sonne vnto Saul.
1Sam.16.21	And Dauid came to Saul, Ꟶ stode before him, Ꟶ he loued him very well, and he was made his harnesbearer.
1Sam.16.22	And Saul sent to Isai, sayinge: lett Dauid remayne with me, for he hath founde fauour in my syght.
1Sam.16.23	And so it fortuned, that when the euell sprete sent of God came vpon Saul, Dauid toke an harpe, Ꟶ played wyth his hande, Ꟶ so Saul was refreshed, Ꟶ dyd amende, and the euell sprete departed from him.
1Sam.17.1	The Philistines geathered their hoste to battel, and came together to Socoth which is in Iuda, and pitched betwene Sococh Ꟶ Azekah, in the coast of Dammin.
1Sam.17.2	And Saul and the men of Israel came together, and pitched in the Oke valley, and put them selues in araye, to fyght agaynst the Philistines.
1Sam.17.3	And the Philistines stode on an hyll on the one syde, and Israel stode on an hyll on the other syde; and there was a valeye betwene them:
1Sam.17.4	And there came a man betwene them both, out of the tentes of the Philistines, named Goliath of Gath syxe cubytes and an handbredth longe,
1Sam.17.5	and had an helmet of brasse vpon hys heed, and a coate of mayle about hym. And the weyght of hys coate of mayle was fyue thousande sykles of brasse.
1Sam.17.6	And he had bootes of brasse vpon his legges, and a shylde of brasse vpon his shoulders.
1Sam.17.7	And the shafte of his spere was like a weuers beame. And his speare heed weyed .vj. hundred sikles of yron. And one bearynge a shylde went before hym.
1Sam.17.8	And he stode and cryed agaynst the hoste of Israel, Ꟶ sayde vnto them: Why are ye come out in araye to battell? am not I a Philistine and you seruauntes to Saul? chose you a man from amonge you, Ꟶ lett him come downe to me.
1Sam.17.9	And yf he be able to fyght with me, Ꟶ to beate me, then will we be youre seruauntes. But yf I can ouercome him and beate him, then shall ye be oure seruauntes, Ꟶ serue vs.
1Sam.17.10	And the Philistine sayde: I defye the host of Israel this daye, geue me a man, that we maye fight together:
1Sam.17.11	When Saul and all Israel hearde those wordes of the Philistine, they were discouraged, Ꟶ greatly afrayed.
1Sam.17.12	Dauid was the sonne of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem Iuda, named Isai, whych had eight sonnes. And was an olde man in the dayes of Saul, and came to age amonge men.
1Sam.17.13	And the thre eldest sonnes of Isai went, and folowed Saul to the battell. And the names of hys thre sonnes that went to battell, were: Eliab the eldest, Ꟶ the next, Abinadab, and the thyrde Samma,
1Sam.17.14	and Dauid was the least. And the thre eldest went after Saul.
1Sam.17.15	Dauid also went and departed from Saul, to fede his fathers shepe at Bethlehem.
1Sam.17.16	And the Philistine came forth in the mornynge and euenynge, and continued fourtye dayes.
1Sam.17.17	And Isai sayde vnto Dauid his sonne take for thy brethren an Epha of this parched corne and these ten loaues, and brynge it vnto the hoste to thy brethren.
1Sam.17.18	And carye these ten freshe cheses vnto the captayne, Ꟶ loke howe thy brethren fare, and fett out their pledge.
1Sam.17.19	And Saul and they, and all the men of Israel were in the oke valey, fightinge with the Philistines.
1Sam.17.20	And Dauid rose vp erlye in the mornynge, and lefte the shepe with a keper, Ꟶ toke and went as Isai had commaunded him, and came with in the compasse of the host. And the hoste went out in araye, and showted in the battell:
1Sam.17.21	for Israel Ꟶ the Philistines had put them selues in araye, the one agaynst the other.
1Sam.17.22	And Dauid toke downe the gear from him, and put them vnder the handes of the keper of the vessels, Ꟶ ranne into the hoste, and came, and saluted his brethren.
1Sam.17.23	And as he talked wt them, Beholde: there stode a man in the myddes (Goliath the Philistine by name) of Gath out of the araye of the Philistines, Ꟶ spake of the maner aboue rehersed, that Dauid hearde it.
1Sam.17.24	And all the men of Israel, when they sawe the man, ranne awaye from hym, and were sore afrayed.
1Sam.17.25	And euery man of Israel sayde: Sawe ye thys man come forth? euen to reuyle Israel is he come. And to hym that beateth hym, wyll the kynge geue great ryches, and will geue him his daughter therto: yee Ꟶ make his fathers house fre in Israel.
1Sam.17.26	And Dauid spake to the men that stode by, and sayde: What shalbe done to the man that beateth this Philistine, Ꟶ taketh awaye the shame from Israel? And what is thys vncircumcised Philistine, that he shulde reuyle the hoste of the lyuinge God?
1Sam.17.27	And the people answered him (after this maner,) sayinge: so shall it be done to the man, that beateth hym.
1Sam.17.28	And Eliab his eldest brother hearde when he spake vnto the men, and Eliab was angrye wt Dauid, and sayde: Why camest thou downe hither? and with whom hast thou lefte those few shepe in the wildernesse? I know thy pryde, and the malyce of thyne herte, that thou art come downe to se the battell.
1Sam.17.29	And Dauid sayd: And what haue I nowe done? is there not a worde?
1Sam.17.30	And he departed from hym into the presence of another, and spake of the same maner, and the people answered hym agayne, as before.
1Sam.17.31	And they that hearde the wordes whych Dauid spake, rehearsed them before Saul, which caused him to be fett.
1Sam.17.32	And Dauid sayd to Saul: Let no mannes hert fayle hym because of him. Thy seruaunt wyll go, Ꟶ fyght with yonder Philistine.
1Sam.17.33	And Saul sayde to Dauid agayne: thou art not able to go agaynst yonder Philistine, to fyght wt him. For thou art but a chylde, but he is a man of warre euen from his youth.
1Sam.17.34	Dauid answered vnto Saul. Thy seruaunt kept his fathers shepe, Ꟶ there came a Lyon and lykewise a Beare, Ꟶ toke a shepe out of the flocke.
1Sam.17.35	And I went out after him, and smote hym, and toke it out of his mouth. And when he arose agaynst me, I caught him by the bearde, and smote hym, Ꟶ slue hym.
1Sam.17.36	And so thy seruaunt slue the Lyon Ꟶ the beare (also) hath thy seruaunt slayne. And truly thys vncircumcised Philistine shalbe as one of them seynge he hath rayled on the hoste of the lyuing God.
1Sam.17.37	And Dauid spake moreouer: the Lorde that deliuered me out of the hande of the Lyon Ꟶ out of the hande of the beare, he shall delyuer me also out of the hande of this Philistine: And Saul sayde vnto Dauid: go, and the Lorde shall be with the.
1Sam.17.38	And Saul put hys rayment vpon Dauid, and put an helmet of brasse vpon hys heed, Ꟶ put a coate of mayle vpon him,
1Sam.17.39	and gyrded Dauid with hys awne swerde vpon his rayment And he assayed to go. And because he neuer proued it, Dauid sayde vnto Saul: I cannot go with these, for I haue not vsed myselfe therto: and Dauid put them of hym,
1Sam.17.40	and toke hys staffe in hys hande, and chose him fyue smoth stones oute of a broke, and put them in a sheperdes bagge which he had, Ꟶ in a slynge poke: Ꟶ his slynge was in his hande, Ꟶ he went to the Philistine.
1Sam.17.41	And the Philistine came and drue nere agaynst Dauid, and the man that bare the shilde went before hym.
1Sam.17.42	And when the Philistine loked aboute, and sawe Dauid, he disdayned him, for he was but yonge, and well coloured, and goodlye to loke vpon.
1Sam.17.43	And the Philistine said vnto Dauid: am I a dogge, that thou comest to me with a staffe? and the Philistine cursed Dauid in the name of his goddes.
1Sam.17.44	And the Philistine sayde to Dauid: come to me, Ꟶ I wyll geue thy fleshe vnto the foules of the ayre, Ꟶ to the beastes of the felde.
1Sam.17.45	Then sayde Dauid to the Philistine: thou comest to me wyth a swerde, a speare and a shylde: But I come to the in the name of the Lord of hostes, the God of the hoste of Israel, whom thou hast rayled vpon.
1Sam.17.46	This daye shall the Lorde delyuer the into my hande, and I shall smyte the, Ꟶ take thine heed from the, and wyll geue the karcases of the hoste of the Philistines thys daye vnto the foules of the ayre, and to the beastes of the erth, that all they whych be in the worlde, maye knowe, that there is a God in Israel.
1Sam.17.47	And all thys congregacyon shall knowe, that the Lord saueth not with swerd and speare. For the battell is the Lordes, and he shall geue you into oure handes.
1Sam.17.48	And when the Philistine arose to come and drawe nie vnto Dauid, Dauid hasted, Ꟶ ranne into the battayll euen agaynst the Philistine.
1Sam.17.49	And Dauid put his hande in hys bagge, and toke out a stone, and slange it, Ꟶ smote the Philistine in his forheed, that the stone souncke into his forheed and he felle grouelynge to the erth.
1Sam.17.50	And so Dauid ouercame the Philistine with a slyng and a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slue hym, euen whan Dauid had no swerde in hys hande.
1Sam.17.51	But Dauid ranne, and stode vpon the Philistine, Ꟶ toke hys swerde, and drue it out of hys sheth, and slue hym, Ꟶ cutte of hys heed therwith. And when the Philistines sawe, that theyr champyon was deed they fled.
1Sam.17.52	And the men of Israel and of Iuda arose, and showted, Ꟶ folowed after the Philistines, vntyll they came to the valeye, and vnto the gates of Akaron. And the Philistines fell downe wounded by the waye to Saaraiim, euen vnto Gath Ꟶ Akaron.
1Sam.17.53	And the chyldren of Israel returned from chasynge after the Philistines, and spoyled theyr tentes.
1Sam.17.54	And Dauid toke the heed of the Philistine, and brought it to Ierusalem: But he put his armoure in hys tente.
1Sam.17.55	When Saul sawe Dauid go forth agaynst the Philistine, he sayde vnto Abner the captayne of his hoste: Abner, whose sonne is this yong man? Abner answered: as truly as thy soule lyueth (O kynge) I cannot tell.
1Sam.17.56	And the kynge sayde: Enquere thou whose sonne the youngelynge is.
1Sam.17.57	And when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner toke hym, and brought hym before Saul, wyth the heed of the Philistine in hys hande.
1Sam.17.58	And Saul sayde to hym: whose sonne art thou, thou yonge man? Dauid answered: I am the sonne of thy seruaunt Isai the Bethlehemite.
1Sam.18.1	And when he had made an ende of speakynge vnto Saul, the soule of Ionathas was knyt wyth the soule of Dauid, and Ionathas loued hym as hys awne soule.
1Sam.18.2	And Saul toke him that daye, and wolde let him go nomore home to hys fathers house.
1Sam.18.3	And Ionathas made a couenaunt wyth Dauid, because be loued him as his awne soule.
1Sam.18.4	And Ionathas put of his awne coate that was vpon him, Ꟶ gaue it Dauid, Ꟶ therto his cloke, his swerd, his bowe and hys gyrdle.
1Sam.18.5	And Dauid went oute whether soeuer Saul sent hym, and behaued him selfe wysely. And Saul sett hym ouer hys men of warre, and he was accepted in the syght of all the people, and in the syght of Sauls seruauntes.
1Sam.18.6	And it happened as they went, when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that wemen came out of all cyties of Israel syngynge Ꟶ daunsyng, agaynst kynge Saul, and wyth tymbrelles, wyth ioye, and with instrumentes of musick.
1Sam.18.7	And the wemen answered one another in theyr playe, Ꟶ sayde Saul hath slayne his thousande, and Dauid hys ten thousande.
1Sam.18.8	And Saul was excedyng wroth, and the sayinge displeased him, and he sayde: they haue ascribed vnto Dauid ten thousande, and to me but a thousande, Ꟶ what can he more haue, saue the kyngdome?
1Sam.18.9	Wherfore Saul loked on syde of Dauid from that daye forwarde.
1Sam.18.10	And it happened on the morowe, that the euell sprete sent of God came vpon Saul, and he prophesyed in the myddes of the house. And Dauid played with hys hande lyke as at other tymes,
1Sam.18.11	and there was a iauelyng in Sauls hande. And Saul toke the iauelyng, Ꟶ sayde: I wyll nayle Dauid to the wall with it. And Dauid auoyded oute of hys presence two tymes.
1Sam.18.12	And Saul was afearde of Dauid, because the Lord was with hym, Ꟶ was departed from Saul.
1Sam.18.13	Therfore Saul put him from hym, and made him a captayne ouer a thousand, and he went out Ꟶ in before the people.
1Sam.18.14	And Dauid behaued him selfe wysely in all his wayes, Ꟶ the Lord was with him.
1Sam.18.15	Wherfore when Saul saw that he was so excedynge wyse, he was afrayd of him.
1Sam.18.16	But all Israel and Iuda loued Dauid, because he went out and in before them.
1Sam.18.17	And Saul sayde to Dauid. Beholde, my eldest daughter Merob, her I wyll geue the to wyfe Only playe the man with me, and fyght the Lordes batelles. For Saul thought: myne hande shall not be vpon hym, but the hand of the Philistines.
1Sam.18.18	And Dauid answered Saul: what am I? and what is my lyfe or the kynred of my father in Israel, that I shulde be sonne in lawe to the kynge?
1Sam.18.19	Howbeit when the tyme was come that Merob Sauls daughter shulde haue bene geuen to Dauid, she was geuen vnto Adriel a Meholothite, to wyfe.
1Sam.18.20	Howbeit, Michol Sauls daughter loued Dauid. And they shewed Saul: Ꟶ the thynge displeased him not.
1Sam.18.21	And Saul sayde: I wyll geue hym her that she maye be a snare to hym, Ꟶ that the hande of the Philistines maye be agaynst him. Wherfore Saul sayde to Dauid: thou shalt this daye be my sonne in lawe in the other daughter.
1Sam.18.22	And Saul commaunded hys seruauntes, to comen wyth Dauid secretlye Ꟶ to saye: Beholde the kyng hath a fauoure to the, and all his seruauntes loue the, be nowe therfore the kynges sonne in lawe.
1Sam.18.23	And Sauls seruauntes spake those wordes in the eares of Dauid. And Dauid sayde: semeth it to you a lyght thynge to be a kynges sonne in lawe: I am a poore man and of smalle reputacion.
1Sam.18.24	And the seruauntes brought Saul worde agayne, sayinge: of this maner spake Dauid.
1Sam.18.25	And Saul sayd: this wise shal ye saye to Dauid: the kynge careth for no nother dowrye, but for an hundred foreskynnes of the Philistines, to be aduenged of the kynges enemyes. But Saul thought to make Dauid fall into the handes of the Philistines.
1Sam.18.26	And when hys seruauntes tolde Dauid these wordes, it pleased Dauid well to be the kynges sonne in lawe.
1Sam.18.27	And or the dayes were expyred, Dauid arose with his men, and went Ꟶ slue of the Philistines, two hundred men, and Dauid brought theyr foreskynnes, and satisfyed the kynge therof, to be hys sonne in lawe. Wherfore Saul gaue hym Michol hys daughter to wyfe.
1Sam.18.28	And Saul sawe and vnderstode, howe that the Lorde was with Dauid, and that Michol his daughter loued hym,
1Sam.18.29	and he was the moare afrayed of Dauid, and Saul became alwaye Dauids enemie.
1Sam.18.30	The lordes of the Philistines vsed to go furth. And it fortuned that whan they went furth, Dauid behaued hym selfe wyselier then all the seruauntes of Saul: so that his name was moche set by.
1Sam.19.1	Saul spake to Ionathas hys sonne, and to all hys seruauntes, that they shulde kyll Dauid.
1Sam.19.2	But Ionathas Sauls sonne had a greate fauoure to Dauid, and Ionathas tolde Dauid sayinge: Saul my father goeth aboute to slaye the. Nowe therfore take hede to thy selfe vntyll the mornynge, and abyde in some secret place, and hyde thy selfe.
1Sam.19.3	And I wyll go oute, and stande by my father in the felde where thou art, and wyll comen wyth my father of the, and whatsoeuer I se, I wyll tell the.
1Sam.19.4	And Ionathas spake good of Dauid vnto Saul hys father, and sayde vnto hym: let not the kynge synne agaynst hys seruaunt Dauid, for he hath not synned agaynst the, and hys workes haue bene to the ward very good.
1Sam.19.5	For he dyd put hys lyfe in hys hande, and slue the Philistine, and the Lorde brought to passe a greate health for all Israel. Thou sawest it, and thou reioysedest, wherfore then wilt thou synne against innocent bloude, and slaye Dauid without a cause?
1Sam.19.6	And Saul harkened vnto the voyce of Ionathas, and sware: as truly as the Lorde lyueth, he shall not dye.
1Sam.19.7	And Ionathas called Dauid, and shewed hym all those wordes, Ꟶ brought Dauid to Saul. And he was in his presens as in tymes past.
1Sam.19.8	And the warre began agayne, and Dauid went out and fought wyth the Philistines, and slue them with a great slaughter, Ꟶ they fledde from him.
1Sam.19.9	And the euell sprete sent of the Lorde was vpon Saul, as he sat in hys house hauinge a Iauelinge in his hande, and Dauid played with his hande.
1Sam.19.10	And Saul entended to nayle Dauid to the walle with the Iauelynge. But he ryd hym selfe out of Sauls presens, as he smote the speare into the walle. And Dauid fledde Ꟶ was saued the same nyght.
1Sam.19.11	Saul also sent messengers vnto Dauids house, to watch him, and to sleye him in the mornynge. And Michol Dauids wyfe tolde it him, sayinge: If thou saue not thy selfe this night, to morowe thou wilt be slayne.
1Sam.19.12	And so Michol lett Dauid downe thorowe a wyndowe, and he went, Ꟶ fled, and was saued.
1Sam.19.13	And then she toke an Image and layed it in the bed, and put a pyllowe stuffed with goates hearre vnder the heed of it, and couered it with a clothe.
1Sam.19.14	And when Saul sent messengers to fetche Dauid, she sayde, he is sycke.
1Sam.19.15	And Saul sent the messengers agayne to se Dauid, sayinge: bringe him to me, bed Ꟶ all, that I maye slaye him.
1Sam.19.16	And when the messengers were come in: Beholde, there laye an ymage in the bed, with a pyllowe of goates heare vnder the heed of it.
1Sam.19.17	And Saul sayde vnto Michol: why hast thou mocked me so, and sent awaye myne enemy that he is escaped? Michol answered Saul. For he sayde vnto me, let me go, or elles I wyll kyll the.
1Sam.19.18	And so Dauid fledde, and escaped, Ꟶ came to Samuel to Rama, tolde hym all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went, and dwelt in Naioth.
1Sam.19.19	And one tolde Saul, sayinge: Beholde, Dauid is at Naioth in Rama.
1Sam.19.20	And Saul sent messengers to fett Dauid. And when they sawe a companye of prophetes prophesyenge, Ꟶ Samuel standynge fast by them, the sprete of God fell vpon the messengers of Saul, and they prophesyed to.
1Sam.19.21	And when it was tolde Saul, he sent other messengers, Ꟶ they prophesyed lykewyse. And Saul sent messengers yet agayne the thyrde tyme, and they prophesyed also.
1Sam.19.22	Then went he hym selfe to Rama, Ꟶ came to a great well that is in Sechu, Ꟶ he asked and sayde: where are Samuel and Dauid? And one sayde: Beholde, they be at Naioth in Rama,
1Sam.19.23	Ꟶ he went thyther, euen to Naioth in Rama, and the sprete of God came vpon him also, Ꟶ he went prophesyinge, vntyll he came to Naioth in Rama.
1Sam.19.24	And he stripte of his clothes, Ꟶ prophesyed before Samuel in lyke maner, and fell naked all that daye Ꟶ all that nyght. And therof it is, that they saye: is Saul also amonge the prophetes?
1Sam.20.1	And Dauid fled from Naioth which is in Rama, came, Ꟶ sayde before Ionathas. What haue I done? wherin am I faultie? what is the synne that I haue committed before thy father, that he seketh my lyfe?
1Sam.20.2	He sayde vnto him: God forbyd, thou shalt not dye. Beholde, my father will do nothynge ether great or small, but that he will shewe it me. And howe shulde my father hyde thys thynge from me? He wyll not do it.
1Sam.20.3	And Dauid sware againe, and sayde, thy father knoweth that I haue founde grace in thyne eyes, and therfore he sayeth: Ionathas shall not knowe it, leste he be sorye. And in very dede, euen as truly as the Lorde lyueth, and as truly as thy soule lyueth, there is but a steppe betwene me and deeth.
1Sam.20.4	Then sayde Ionathas vnto Dauid: whatsoeuer thy soule desyreth that I wyll do vnto the.
1Sam.20.5	And Dauid sayde vnto Ionathas: Beholde to morowe is the begynnynge of the moneth, and I shulde sytt wt the kynge at meate. But let me go, that I maye hyde my selfe in the feldes vnto the thyrde daye at euen.
1Sam.20.6	If thy father speake of me, then saye, Dauid asked leaue of me, that he myght go to Bethlehem to his awne cytie, for there is holden a yerely feast for all the kynred.
1Sam.20.7	And yf he saye: it is well done, then thy seruaunt shall haue peace. But and yf he be angrye, then be sure that wyckednesse is vtterlye concluded of hym.
1Sam.20.8	And then thou shalt shewe mercye vnto thy seruaunt for thou hast made wyth me thy seruaunt a bonde in the Lorde. Notwithstandynge, yf there be in me any trespace, then sleye me thy selfe, and brynge me not to thy father.
1Sam.20.9	And Ionathas answered, God kepe that from the. For yf I knowe, that wyckednesse were concluded of my father, to come vpon the, thynkest thou that I shulde not tell it the?
1Sam.20.10	Then sayde Dauid, who shall tell me, yf thy father answere cruelly?
1Sam.20.11	And Ionathas sayd vnto Dauid, come and lett vs go out into the felde. And they went out both of them into the felde.
1Sam.20.12	And Ionathas sayde vnto Dauid? The Lorde God of Israel loke on it, when I haue groped my fathers mynde, one tyme or other within this thre dayes, that it stande well with Dauid. If I then sende not vnto the Ꟶ shewe it the,
1Sam.20.13	the Lord do so and so vnto Ionathas. But yf my father haue any pleasure to do the euell, I wyll shewe the also, and sende the awaye that thou mayst go in peace. And the Lorde be wyth the, as he hath bene with my father.
1Sam.20.14	And thou shalt performe vnto me the mercy of the Lorde, not onely whyle I lyue but euen when I am deed,
1Sam.20.15	and plucke not thy mercy awaye from my house for euer: No not when the Lorde hath destroyed the enemyes of Dauid, euery one from the face of the erth.
1Sam.20.16	And so Ionathas made a bonde with the house of Dauid, desyringe that the Lord shulde seke it out by the handes of Dauids enemyes (yf it were broken.)
1Sam.20.17	And wt other wordes dyd Ionathas sweare vnto Dauid, because he loued him. For he loued him, as his awne soule.
1Sam.20.18	Then sayde Ionathas to Dauid: to morowe is the first daye of the mone. And thou shalt be missed, because the place where thou wast wont to sytt, shall be emptye.
1Sam.20.19	Therfore this daye thre dayes come downe in any wyse vnto the place where thou dyddest hyde thy selfe, whan the busynes was in hande: euen by the stone Esell.
1Sam.20.20	And I wyll shote thre arowes by the one syde therof, as though I shott them at a marke,
1Sam.20.21	Ꟶ will sende a lad, and byd hym go seke the arowes. And yf I saye vnto the lad: se, the arowes are on thys syde the brynge them: then come thou: for it is peace, Ꟶ no hurte, as sure as the Lorde lyueth.
1Sam.20.22	But and yf I saye vnto the lad, beholde, the arowes are be yonde the, then go for the Lord hath sent the awaye.
1Sam.20.23	And as touchynge this which thou and I haue spoken: beholde the Lorde be betwene the Ꟶ me for euer.
1Sam.20.24	And so Dauid hyd him selfe in the felde. And when the newe mone was come, the kynge sat him downe to eate meate.
1Sam.20.25	And the kynge sat him downe after the olde maner, in hys seate by the wall. And Ionathas arose and Abner sate by Sauls syde, Ꟶ Dauids place was emptye.
1Sam.20.26	Neuerthelesse, Saul sayde nothinge at all that daye. For he thought: some thynge hath chaunced him that he is not cleane.
1Sam.20.27	But on the morowe which was the seconde daye of the newe mone, it happened that Dauids place was emptye agayne. And Saul sayde vnto Ionathas his sonne. Wherfore commeth not the sonne of Isai to meate, nether yesterdaye nor to daye?
1Sam.20.28	And Ionathas answered vnto Saul. Dauid asked lycence of me, to go to Bethlehem,
1Sam.20.29	for he sayde: let me go I praye the for oure kynred dothe holde an offerynge in the cytie, and my brother hath sent for me. And therfore yf I haue founde fauoure in thyne eyes, lett me go, and se my brethren. This is the cause, that he commeth not vnto the kynges table.
1Sam.20.30	Then was Saul angrye with Ionathas, Ꟶ sayde vnto him: Thou wycked rebell, do not I knowe, that thou hast chosen the sonne of Isai vnto thyne awne rebuke, Ꟶ vnto the rebuke Ꟶ shame of thy mother?
1Sam.20.31	For as longe as the sonne of Isai lyueth vpon the erth, thou shalt not be stablished, nor yet thy kingdome, wherfore now sende and sett him vnto me, for he is the chylde of deeth.
1Sam.20.32	And Ionathas answered vnto Saul his father, and sayde to him. Wherfore shulde he dye? what hath he done?
1Sam.20.33	And Saul lyfte vp a speare to hyt him, wherby Ionathas wyst well, that it was vtterlye determined of his father; to sleye Dauid.
1Sam.20.34	And so Ionathas arose from the table in a greate anger, Ꟶ dyd eate no meat the seconde daye of the moneth, for he was sory for Dauid, because hys father had done him shame.
1Sam.20.35	On the nexte morning, Ionathas went out into the felde, at the tyme apoynted with Dauid, Ꟶ a lytle ladd with him.
1Sam.20.36	And he sayde vnto his boye: runne Ꟶ seke out myne arowes whych I shote. And as the boye ran he shot an arowe beyonde him.
1Sam.20.37	And when the lad was come to the place whether Ionathas had shot the arowe, Ionathas cryed after the lad, and sayde: Is not the arowe beyonde the?
1Sam.20.38	And Ionathas cried after the lad agayne: make spede, and stande not styll. And Ionathas lad geathered vp the arowes, Ꟶ came to his master.
1Sam.20.39	But the lad wist nothinge of the matter. Onely Ionathas and Dauid wist it.
1Sam.20.40	And Ionathas gaue his weapons vnto the lad that was wyth him, Ꟶ sayde vnto him: go Ꟶ carye them to the towne.
1Sam.20.41	And as sone as the lad was gone, Dauid arose out of a place that was towarde the south, and fell on hys face to the grounde, and worshypped thre tymes. And they kissed ether other, Ꟶ wept together so longe, tyll Dauid exceaded in weping.
1Sam.20.42	And Ionathas sayde to Dauid: go in peace. And the thynges which we haue sworne both of vs in the name of the Lorde, sayinge: the Lorde be betwene the Ꟶ me, Ꟶ betwene thy sede Ꟶ myne, let them stonde for euer. And he arose, Ꟶ departed. And Ionathas went into the towne.
1Sam.21.1	Then came Dauid to Nob to Ahimelech the preast: And Ahimelech was astonyed at the sodayne commynge of Dauid, Ꟶ sayd vnto him: Why art thou alone, Ꟶ no man wt the?
1Sam.21.2	And Dauid sayde to Ahimelech the preaste: the kynge hath commaunded me to do a certeyn thynge, and hath sayde vnto me, let no man knowe where aboute I sende the, and what I haue commannded the to do. And I haue appoynted my seruauntes, to soche and soche places.
1Sam.21.3	Nowe therfore yf thou hast ought vnder thyne hande geue me fyue loues of breade, or what cometh to hande.
1Sam.21.4	And the preast answered Dauid, and sayde: there is no comen bread vnder myne hande, but here is halowed bread, yf the younge men haue kepte them selues from vncleane thynges especiallye wemen.
1Sam.21.5	Dauid answered the Preaste, and sayde vnto hym: of a truth wemen hath bene locked vp from vs about a thre dayes. When I came out, Ꟶ the vesselles of the young men were holy. How be it this waye is vnpure, and how much more shal there be holynes in the vessell.
1Sam.21.6	And so the preast gaue him halowed bred, for there was no nother bred there, saue the shewebreds, that were taken from before the Lorde, to put freshe bred there, the daye that it was taken awaye.
1Sam.21.7	And ther was there the same daye a certen man of the seruauntes of Saul abydyng before the Lorde, named Doeg an Edomite, the chefest of Sauls hearde men.
1Sam.21.8	And Dauid sayd vnto Ahimelech: is not here vnder thyne hande other speare or swerde? for I haue nether brought my swerde nor my harnesse with me, because the kynge busines required haste.
1Sam.21.9	And the preast sayd: the swerde of Goliath the Philistine whome thou sluest in the Ocke valley, beholde, it is here wrapt in a cloth behynd the Ephod. If thou wilt take that, take it, for there is no nother saue that here. And Dauid sayd: there is none to that, geue it me.
1Sam.21.10	And Dauid arose and fled the same daye from the presence of Saul, Ꟶ went to Achis the kyng of Geth.
1Sam.21.11	And the seruauntes of Achis sayd of him: is not this Dauid the kyng of the lande? dyd they not syng vnto him, in daunses saying Saul hath slayne his thousand, Ꟶ Dauid his ten thousand?
1Sam.21.12	And Dauid put those wordes into his heart, Ꟶ was sore afrayed of Achis the kyng of Geth.
1Sam.21.13	And he chaunged his speche before them, Ꟶ fayned him self madd in theyr handes, Ꟶ scrabled on the dores of the gate, and let his spittel fall downe vpon his bearde.
1Sam.21.14	Then sayde Achis vnto his seruaunte: Loo, ye se that this man is besyde hym selfe, wherfore then haue ye brought hym to me?
1Sam.21.15	Haue I nede of madd men that ye haue brought this felow to playe the mad man in my presence? Shall he come into my howse.
1Sam.22.1	Dauid therfore departed thence, and escaped, and came vnto the caue Odollam. When his brethren also and all his fathers house heard it, they went downe thither to hym.
1Sam.22.2	And there geathered vnto him all men that were in combraunce, and in dett, and troubled in their mindes, Ꟶ he became a captayne ouer them And there were with hym vpon a foure hundred men.
1Sam.22.3	And Dauid went thence to Mizpa in the lande of Moab, and sayde vnto the kyng of Moab: Let my father Ꟶ my mother (I praye the) come forth vnto you, tyll I knowe what God will do for me.
1Sam.22.4	And he brought them before the king of Moab. And they dwelt wt him all the while that Dauid kepte him selfe in hold.
1Sam.22.5	And the prophet Gad sayde vnto Dauid: abide not in holde, but departe and go into the land of Iuda. Then Dauid departed and came into the forest Hareth.
1Sam.22.6	And Saul heard that Dauid was come abrode, and also the men that were wyth hym. And Saul satt in Gibea vnder a tree in Rama, hauyng hys speare in his hand, Ꟶ all his men stode about hym
1Sam.22.7	And Saul sayde vnto his seruauntes that stode about him. Heare I praye you you sonnes of Iemini: will the sonne of Isai geue euery one of you feldes and vineardes, Ꟶ make you all captaynes ouer thousandes Ꟶ ouer hundredes?
1Sam.22.8	that ye haue also conspired agaynst me, and there is none that telleth it me in myne eare. And where as my sonne hath made a bonde wt the sonne of Isai, ther is none of you that mourneth for me, or sheweth it in myne eare: beholde, my sonne hath stered vp my seruaunt to lye awayte agaynst me thys same daye.
1Sam.22.9	Then answered Doeg the Edomite which also stode by the seruauntes of Saul, and sayde: I saw the sonne of Isai, when he cam to Nob, to Ahimelech the sonne of Ahitob,
1Sam.22.10	which asked councell of the Lorde for hym Ꟶ gaue hym vitayles, Ꟶ the swerde of Goliath the Philistine also.
1Sam.22.11	Then the Kynge sent Ꟶ called for Ahimelech the preast the sonne of Ahitob, Ꟶ all his fathers house: that is to saye, the preastes that were in Nob. And they cam all to the kyng.
1Sam.22.12	And Saul sayde: heare now thou sonne of Ahitob. He answered: here I am, my Lorde.
1Sam.22.13	And Saul sayde vnto hym: why haue ye conspired agaynst me, thou Ꟶ the sonne of Isai, in that thou hast geuen him vitaile, Ꟶ a swerde, and hast asked councell of God for him, that he shuld aryse agaynst me, Ꟶ lye awayte for me this daye?
1Sam.22.14	Ahimelech answered the king Ꟶ sayd who is so faithfull among all thy seruauntes as Dauid, Ꟶ therto the kinges sonne in law, Ꟶ goeth at thy bydding, Ꟶ is had in honoure in thyne house?
1Sam.22.15	haue I this daye begonne first to aske councell of God for him. That be farre from me: yf I had knowen it, lett not the kyng put soch a thyng vnto his seruaunt, in all the house of my father. For thy seruaunt knew nothing of all this, ether lesse or moare.
1Sam.22.16	The king sayde: thou shalt surelye dye Ahimelech, thou and all thy fathers house
1Sam.22.17	And the king sayde vnto the fote men that stode about him: turne, Ꟶ sley the preastes of the Lord, both because their hand is with Dauid, Ꟶ because they knewe when Dauid fleed, Ꟶ shewed it not to me. But the seruauntes of the kyng wolde not moue their handes, to fall vpon the preastes of the Lorde.
1Sam.22.18	And the kyng sayde to Doeg: turne thou, and fall vpon the preastes. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and ranne vpon the preastes, and slue that same daye foure skore Ꟶ fyue persones, that dyd weare a lynnen Ephod.
1Sam.22.19	And Nob the cytie of the preastes smote he wyth the edge of the swerde, both men Ꟶ wemen, children and sucklynges, oxen and asses and shepe.
1Sam.22.20	And one of the sonnes of Ahimelech the sonne of Ahitob (named Abiathar) escaped Ꟶ fled to Dauid.
1Sam.22.21	And Abiathar shewed Dauid, how that Saul had slayne the lordes preastes.
1Sam.22.22	And Dauid sayde vnto Abiathar: I wilt it the same daye, whan Doeg the Edomite was there, that he wolde tell Saul. And I am cause of the deeth of all the soules of thy fathers house.
1Sam.22.23	Abide thou wt me, and feare not: For yf anye man seke my soule, he shall seke thyne also, wt me thou shalt be in sauegard.
1Sam.23.1	Then they told Dauid saying: Behold the Philistines fight agaynst keilah, and spoyle the barnes.
1Sam.23.2	Therfore Dauid asked the Lords aduyse, saying: shall I goo and smyte these Philistines? And the Lorde answered vnto Dauid: go and smyte the Philistines, and saue keilah.
1Sam.23.3	And Dauids men that were with him, sayd vnto him: se, we be afrayed here in Iuda: how much more then yf we come to keila agaynst the host of the Philistynes?
1Sam.23.4	Then Dauid asked the Lorde agayne. And the Lord answered him and sayde: Aryse, Ꟶ go downe to keila, for I will delyuer the Philistines in to thyne hande.
1Sam.23.5	And so Dauid and his men went to keila, and fought with the Philistynes, Ꟶ droue awaye their catell, and smote them with a great slaughter. And so Dauid saued the enhabiters of keila.
1Sam.23.6	And it chaunced, when Abiathar the sonne of Ahimelech fled to Dauid to keila, that he brought an Ephod with him in his hande.
1Sam.23.7	And it was tolde Saul, that Dauid was come to keila. And Saul sayde: God hath delyuered him into myne hand. For he is shut in now that he is come into a towne that hath gates Ꟶ barres.
1Sam.23.8	And Saul called all the people together to warre, for to go downe to keila, and to besege Dauid Ꟶ his men.
1Sam.23.9	And Dauid hauing knowlege that Saul imagened myschef against him, sayd, to Abiathar the preast: Bryng the Ephod.
1Sam.23.10	Then sayde Dauid: O Lord God of Israel, thi seruaunt hath heard, that Saul is about to come against keila to destroye the cytie for my sake:
1Sam.23.11	Wyll the men of keyla delyuer me into hys hande? And will Saul come downe, as thy seruaunt hath heard saye? O Lord God of Israel, tell they seruaunt. And the Lorde sayde: he will come downe.
1Sam.23.12	Then sayd Dauid: will the men of keila delyuer me and the men that are with me into the hand of Saul? Ꟶ the Lord sayde: they will betraye you.
1Sam.23.13	Then dauid Ꟶ his men which were vpon a syxe hundred, arose Ꟶ departed out of keila Ꟶ went whether they could. And it was told Saul, that Dauid was fled from keila, Ꟶ he let the iourney a lone.
1Sam.23.14	Dauid abode in the wildernesse in strong holdes, Ꟶ remayned in a mountayne in the wildernesse of ziph. And Saul sought him euery daye, but God delyuered him not into his hand.
1Sam.23.15	And Dauid saw that Saul was come out, to seke his life. And Dauid was in the wyldernesse of ziph in a thickett.
1Sam.23.16	And Ionathas Sauls sonne arose, Ꟶ went to Dauid in to the thicket, Ꟶ comforted his hand in God,
1Sam.23.17	Ꟶ sayde vnto hym: feare not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not fynd the, Ꟶ thou shalt be king ouer Israel, Ꟶ I must be next vnto the. And that doth Saul my father know.
1Sam.23.18	And they made abonde both of them togeather before the Lorde. And Dauid taryed styll in the thickett, and Ionathas went to his house.
1Sam.23.19	Then came the ziphites to Saul, to Gibea, saying: Doth not Dauid hyde him selfe fast by vs in strong holdes, in a thyckett that is by the hyll of Hachila, on the ryght syde of the wildernesse?
1Sam.23.20	Now therfore kyng, thou mayest come downe according to all the lust of thy soule: come downe, Ꟶ oure parte shalbe to delyuer hym into the kynges hande.
1Sam.23.21	And Saul sayde: Blessed are ye in the Lord: for ye haue compassion on me.
1Sam.23.22	Go I praye you, Ꟶ ordre the matter well, know Ꟶ se his haunte, where hys fote hath bene, and who hath sene him there: for it is tolde me, that he is very sottel, Ꟶ worketh craftely.
1Sam.23.23	Se therfore, Ꟶ know all the lourkyng places, where he hideth him self, and come ye agayne to me with the certentye, Ꟶ I will go wyth you. And yf he be in the land, I will serche him out thorow out all the thousandes of Iuda.
1Sam.23.24	And they arose, and went to ziph before Saul, But Dauid and his men were in the wildernesse of Maon, in the playne that is, on the ryght hand of Iesimon.
1Sam.23.25	Saul also and his men wente to seke: and they tolde Dauid. Wherfore he went vnto a Rocke, and abode in the wildernesse of Maon.
1Sam.23.26	And when Saul hearde that, he folowed after Dauid in the wildernesse of Maon. And Saul Ꟶ his men went on the one syde of the mountayne, Ꟶ Dauid Ꟶ his men on the other syde. And Dauid toke thought, how to get from Saul. For Saul Ꟶ his men compased Dauid Ꟶ his men, rounde about, to take them.
1Sam.23.27	But there cam a messenger to Saul, saying Hast the, Ꟶ come, for the Philistines are come into the land.
1Sam.23.28	Wherfore, Saul returned from persecuting Dauid, Ꟶ went agaynst the Philistines. And therfore is it, that they called the place: The rock of separacion.
1Sam.23.29	And Dauid went thence, Ꟶ dwelt in strong holdes at Engadi.
1Sam.24.1	When Saul was come agayne from folowing after the Philistines, it fortuned, that there were, which told him saying: beholde, Dauid is in the wildernesse of Engadi.
1Sam.24.2	Then Saul toke thre thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seke Dauid and his men in the height of the Rockes, where wilde gootes remayne.
1Sam.24.3	And he cam to the flockes of shepe in the waye. And Saul went in to a caue to couer his fete. And Dauid and hys men remayned in the inward partes of the caue.
1Sam.24.4	And the men of Dauid sayd vnto him: se, the daye is come, of which the Lorde sayde vnto the: Beholde: I will delyuer thyne enemyes into thyne hand, Ꟶ thou shalt do to him as it shall seme good in thy syght. Then Dauid arose and cutt of a lappe of Sauls garment priuelye.
1Sam.24.5	And immediatly Dauids hert smote hym because he had cutt of a lapp of Sauls garment.
1Sam.24.6	And he sayde vnto his men: the Lorde kepe me from doing that thing vnto my master the Lords anoynted, to laye mine hande vpon hym, seyng he is the anoynted of the Lorde.
1Sam.24.7	And so Dauid kept of hys seruauntes with these wordes, and soffred them not to ryse agaynst Saul. But Saul rose vp out of the caue Ꟶ went awaye,
1Sam.24.8	Dauid also arose and went out of of the caue, and cryed after Saul, saying: My Lorde kyng. And when Saul loked behynde hym. Dauid stowped to the erth, and bowed him self,
1Sam.24.9	Ꟶ sayd to Saul: wherfore geuest thou an eare to mennes wordes that saye, Dauid seketh euell agaynst the?
1Sam.24.10	Beholde, this daye thyne eyes haue sene. how that the Lord had delyuered the thys daye into myne hand in the caue. And some bad me kyll the, but I had compassion on the, and sayde: I will not laye my handes on my master, for he is the Lordes anointed.
1Sam.24.11	And moreouer, my father, behold, Ꟶ se yet the lapp of thy garment in my hand: in as moch as I kylled the not, when I cutt of the lapp of thy garment. Understande therfore Ꟶ se, that there is nether euell nor wickednesse in me, and that I haue not synned agaynst the. And yet thou huntest after my soule to take it.
1Sam.24.12	The Lord be iudge betwene the and me, and the Lorde aduenge me of the. But myne hand be not vpon the.
1Sam.24.13	Accordyng as the olde prouerbe sayeth: wyckednesse proceadeth from the wycked: But myne hande be not vpon the.
1Sam.24.14	After whom is the kyng of Israel come out? After whom dost thou moue persecucion? after a deed dogg, and after a flee.
1Sam.24.15	The Lorde be iudge, and iudge betwene the and me, Ꟶ se Ꟶ pleate my cause, and avenge me of thyne hande.
1Sam.24.16	When Dauid had made an ende of speaking these wordes to Saul, Saul sayde is this thy voyce my sonne Dauid? and Saul lyfte vp his voyce, and wepte,
1Sam.24.17	and sayde to Dauid: thou art ryghteouser then I, for thou hast rewarded me with good, where as I haue rewarded the wyth euell.
1Sam.24.18	And thou hast shewed thys daye, how that thou hast dealt louynglye wyth me, for as moche as when the Lorde had locked me in thyne handes, thou kylledst me not.
1Sam.24.19	For who shall finde his enemye, Ꟶ lett him depart in to a good waye? Wherfore the Lord reward the with good, for that thou hast done vnto me this daye.
1Sam.24.20	And now beholde, I wote well that thou shalt be kyng, and that the kingdom of Israel shalbe stablyshed in thyne hande.
1Sam.24.21	Swere now therfore vnto me by the Lord that thou shalt not destroye my seade after me, Ꟶ that thou shalt not put my name out of my fathers house.
1Sam.24.22	And Dauid sware vnto Saul, and Saul went home. But Dauid and his men gatt them vp vnto an hold.
1Sam.25.1	And Samuel dyed, and all the Israelites geathered togeather and lamented hym, and buryed hym in his owne house at Rama. And Dauid arose, and gat hym to the wildernesse of Pharan.
1Sam.25.2	And there was a man in Maon whose possession was in Carmel, and the man was excedyng myghtie, and had thre thousand shepe Ꟶ a thousand gootes. And he was sheryng his shepe in Carmell.
1Sam.25.3	The name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wyfe was Abigail, and she was a woman of a singuler wisdome and bewtifull. But the man was churlyshe, and of shrewde condicions, and was of the kynred of Caleb.
1Sam.25.4	And Dauid heard in the wildernesse, that Nabal dyd shere hys shepe.
1Sam.25.5	And Dauid sent out ten young men, and sayde vnto them: get you vp to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and grete hym in my name.
1Sam.25.6	And thus shal ye saye: peace be to the, peace be to thyne house, Ꟶ peace be vnto all that thou hast.
1Sam.25.7	Beholde, I haue heard saye, that thou hast sherers. Now, thy sheperdes were with vs and we dyd them no spyte, nether was there ought myssing vnto them, all the whyle they were in Carmel:
1Sam.25.8	aske thy laddes, Ꟶ they will shew the. Wherfore let these young men fynde fauore in thine eyes (for we come in a good ceason) and geue I praye the whatsoeuer commeth to thyne hande, vnto thy seruauntes, and to thy sonne Dauid.
1Sam.25.9	And whan Dauids youngmen came, they tolde Nabal all those wordes in the name of Dauid, Ꟶ then helde theyr peace.
1Sam.25.10	And Nabal answered Dauids seruauntes, Ꟶ sayde: what is Dauid? Ꟶ what is the sonne of Isai? there is plentye of seruauntes now a dayes, that breake awaye euery man from his master.
1Sam.25.11	Shal I then take my breed, my water Ꟶ my flesshe, that I haue kylled for my sherers, Ꟶ geue it vnto men whom I wote not whence they be?
1Sam.25.12	And so Dauids seruauntes turned their waye, and went agayne, and came and told him all those sayinges.
1Sam.25.13	And Dauid sayd vnto hys men: gyrde euery man hys swerde aboute him. And they gyrded euery man his swerde aboute him, Ꟶ Dauid was gyrded with his swerde. And there folowed Dauid vpon a foure hundred men, and two hundred abode by the stuffe.
1Sam.25.14	But one of the laddes tolde Abigail Nabals wyfe, saying: Beholde, Dauid sent messengers vnto oure master out of the wildernesse to salute him Ꟶ he rayled on them.
1Sam.25.15	And yet the men are very good vnto vs, Ꟶ dyd vs no displeasure, nether missed we any thing, as long as we were conuersant with them, when we were in the feldes.
1Sam.25.16	They were a wall of defence vnto vs both by nyght Ꟶ daye, all the whyle we were with them keping shepe.
1Sam.25.17	Now therfore, take hede, and se what thou hast to do, for there is an occasion of euell geuen agaynst oure master and all his housholde, seyng: he is as a sonne of beliall vngracious to speake to.
1Sam.25.18	Then Abigail made hast, Ꟶ toke two hundred loues, Ꟶ two bottelles of wine, and fyue shepe readye dressed, and fyue measures of parched corne, and an hundred frayles of reasyngs, and two hundred topnettes of fygges, and laded them on asses,
1Sam.25.19	Ꟶ sayde vnto her young men: go ye before me. Beholde, I come after you. But she tolde her husband Naball nothing therof.
1Sam.25.20	And as she rode on her asse she came preuely downe the syde of the hyll, Ꟶ beholde, Dauid and hys men came downe agaynst her, Ꟶ she met them.
1Sam.25.21	And Dauid sayde: in vayne haue I kept all that this felow hath in the wildernesse: so that nought was myssed of all that pertayned vnto hym. And he hath quite me euell for good.
1Sam.25.22	So and so do God vnto the enemyes of dauid, yf I leaue of all that pertayne to him, by the dawnyng of the daye, any thing that pisseth agaynst the walle.
1Sam.25.23	And when Abigail saw Dauid, she hasted Ꟶ lyghted of her asse, and fell before Dauid on her face, and bowed her self to the ground
1Sam.25.24	and fell at his fete, and sayde: Let this vnhappie deade be counted myne, my Lorde, Ꟶ let thine handmayde speake in thine audience, and heare the wordes of thy handemayde.
1Sam.25.25	Let not my Lorde regard this vnthriftye man Naball: for as his name is, so is he Nabal is his name, Ꟶ follie is wt him. But I thine handmayd saw not the young men of my Lorde whom thou sendedst.
1Sam.25.26	Now therfore my Lorde, as sure as the lord lyueth, Ꟶ as thy soule lyueth, the Lorde hath withholden the from comming to shede bloud, Ꟶ withdraw thou thine hand from bloude sheade Now, I praye God, that thine enemyes Ꟶ they that entende to do my Lorde euel, may be as Nabal.
1Sam.25.27	And now this is the blessyng which thyne hand mayde hath brought vnto my Lord: Ꟶ lett it be geuen vnto the young men, that folow my Lorde.
1Sam.25.28	Forgeue the trespace of thine handmayde, for the Lord will make my Lorde a sure house, because my Lord fyghteth the batayles of the Lorde, and there coulde none euel be founde in the in all thy dayes.
1Sam.25.29	And yf any man ryse to persecute the, Ꟶ to seke thy soule, the soule of my Lorde shall be bound as in the bondell of the lyuing wt the Lord thy God. And the soules of thy enemyes shal God cast out, euen as out of the mydle of a slyng.
1Sam.25.30	And when the Lord shall haue done to my Lord all the good that he hath promised the, Ꟶ shall haue made the ruler ouer Israel:
1Sam.25.31	then shall it be no decaye vnto the, ner discourage of herte vnto my Lorde, that thou hast not shedde bloud causelesse, ner aduenged thy selfe. But when the Lord shall haue dealt well with my Lorde, then thynck on thyne handmayde.
1Sam.25.32	And Dauid sayd to Abigail: blessed be the Lorde God of Israel, which sent the this daye to mete me.
1Sam.25.33	Blessed is thy sayeng, Ꟶ blessed art thou, which hast kept me thys daye from coming to shede bloud, and from aduengyng my self with myne awne hand.
1Sam.25.34	For in very deade, as sure as the Lord God of Israel lyueth, which hath kept me backe from hurtyng the, excepte thou haddest hasted and met me, thinkest thou, there had bene left vnto Nabal by the dawnyng of the daye, a pisser agaynst the wall?
1Sam.25.35	And so Dauid receaued of her hand, that which she had brought him Ꟶ sayd to her: go vp in peace to thyne house. Beholde, I haue herde thy voyce, and haue accepted thy persone.
1Sam.25.36	And Abigail came to Nabal: and behold, he held a feast in his house, lyke the feest of a kyng, Ꟶ Nabals herte was mery within him, for he was very droncke. Wherfore she tolde him nothing, nether lytle nor moare, vntill the morow daye.
1Sam.25.37	But in the mornyng, when the wine was gone out of Naball, hys wife tolde him these wordes, and his herte dyed within him, and he became as a stone
1Sam.25.38	Ꟶ vpon a ten dayes after, the Lorde smote Nabal, that he dyed.
1Sam.25.39	And when Dauid heard that Nabal was deed, he sayde: Blessed be the Lorde that hath iudged the cause of my rebuke of the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his seruaunt from euell, and hath recompensed the wickednesse of Nabal vpon his awne heed. And Dauid sent to comen wt Abigail: to thyn tent to take her to his wife.
1Sam.25.40	And when the seruauntes of Dauid were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake vnto her saying: Dauid sent vs vnto the, to take the to his wife.
1Sam.25.41	And she arose, Ꟶ bowed her self on her face to the erth, and sayde: Beholde let thy handmayde be a seruaunt, to washe the fete of the seruauntes of my Lord.
1Sam.25.42	And Abigail hasted, and arose, and gat her vp vpon an Asse, wt fyue damoselles of hers that went at her fete, and she went after the messengers of Dauid, and became hys wife.
1Sam.25.43	Dauid also toke Ahinoam of Iezrahel, Ꟶ they were both his wiues.
1Sam.25.44	But Saul gaue Michol hys daughter Dauids wyfe to phalti the sonne of Lais which was of Gallim.
1Sam.26.1	The ziphites came vnto Saul to Gibea, saying: Doth not Dauid hyde hym self in the hill of Hachila which is before Iesimon?
1Sam.26.2	Saul arose, and went dwne to the wyldernesse of ziph, hauyng thre thousande chosen men of Israel with hym, for to seke Dauid in the wildernesse of ziph.
1Sam.26.3	And Saul pitched in the hyll of Hachila which lyeth before Iesimon, by the waye side. But Dauid dwelt in the wildernesse. And he saw that Saul cam after hym into he wildernesse.
1Sam.26.4	Dauid therfore sent out spyes, Ꟶ vnderstode, that Saul was come in very dede.
1Sam.26.5	And Dauid arose and came to the placewhere Saul had pitched, Ꟶ Dauid beheld the place, where Saul laye, and Abner the sonne of Ner which was his chefe captayne Saul laye within, Ꟶ the people Ꟶ the hooste rounde about him.
1Sam.26.6	Then answered Dauid and spake to Ahimelech the Hethite, Ꟶ to Abisai the sonne of zaruia and brother to Ioab, saying: who will go downe with me to Saul to the hoste? And Abisai saide: I will go downe with the.
1Sam.26.7	And so Dauid and Abisai came downe to the people by nyght. And beholde, Saul laye sleping within the hoost, Ꟶ his speare stacke in the ground at his heed. But Abner Ꟶ the people laye round about hym.
1Sam.26.8	Then sayde Abisai to Dauid: God hath deliuered thyne enemye into thyne hande this daye. Now therfore, lett me smyte hym once with my speare to the erth, Ꟶ I wyll not smyte hym the seconde tyme.
1Sam.26.9	And Dauid sayde to Abisai: destroye him not. For who can laye his hande on the Lordes anoynted, Ꟶ be gyltlesse?
1Sam.26.10	And Dauid sayde furthermore: as sure as the Lorde lyueth, the Lorde shall smyte him or his daye shall come to dye, or he shall descende into battell, Ꟶ there perishe.
1Sam.26.11	The Lord kepe me from laying myne hande vpon the Lordes anoynted: But take thou now the speare that is at his heed, Ꟶ the crewse of water, Ꟶ let vs go.
1Sam.26.12	And so Dauid toke the speare Ꟶ the crewse of water from Sauls heed, and they gatt them awaye, and no man saw it or marked yt or awaked. For they were all a slepe, because the Lorde had sent a deade sleape vpon them.
1Sam.26.13	Then Dauid went ouer to the other syde, and stode on the toppe of an hyll a farre of (a great space beyng betwene them)
1Sam.26.14	and Dauid cryed to the people, and to Abner the sonne of Ner, saying: Hearest thou not Abner? Abner answered, and sayde: What art thou that cryest to the king?
1Sam.26.15	and Dauid sayd to Abner: art not thou a man: and who his lyke the in Israel? Wherfore then hast thou not kept thy Lord the kyng? For there came one of the folke in, to destroy the kyng thy lord.
1Sam.26.16	It is not good that thou hast done. As truly as the Lorde lyueth, ye are worthy to dye, because ye haue not kepte youre master, the Lordes anoynted. And nowe se where the kynges speare is and the crewse of water, that was at his heed.
1Sam.26.17	And Saul knew Dauids voyce, Ꟶ sayde is this thy voyce my sonne Dauid? Ꟶ Dauid sayd: it is my voyce, my Lord, O kyng
1Sam.26.18	And he sayde: wherfore doth my lord thus persecute his seruaunt? for what haue I done? or what euell is in myne hand?
1Sam.26.19	Now therfore let my Lord the kyng heare the wordes of his seruaunt. If the Lorde haue stered the vp agaynst me, let him smell the sauoure of a sacrifice. But Ꟶ yf they be the children of men, cursed are they before the lord For they haue cast me out this daye from abidyng in the enheritaunce of the Lord, saying: hence, Ꟶ go serue other gods.
1Sam.26.20	Now therfore let not my bloud fall to the erth before the face of the lorde. For the king of Israell is come out to hunt a flee, as whan one doth hunt a partrege in the mountaynes.
1Sam.26.21	Then sayde Saul: I haue synned, come agayn my sonne Dauid, for I will do the no moare harme, because my soule was preciouse in thyne eyes thys daye. Beholde, I haue played the fole, Ꟶ haue erred excedyngly.
1Sam.26.22	And Dauid answered and sayd: Behold, the kyngs speare, lett one of the young men come ouer, Ꟶ fett it.
1Sam.26.23	The Lorde reward euery man accordyng to his ryghtwesnesse Ꟶ fayth: for the Lordde delyuered the into my hand thys daye, but I wolde not laye myne hand vpon the Lordes anoynted.
1Sam.26.24	And beholde, lyke as thy lyfe was moche set bye this daye in myne eyes: so be my lyfe set by in the eyes of the Lorde, that he delyuer me out of all tribulacion.
1Sam.26.25	Then Saul sayd to Dauid: Blessed art thou my sonne Dauid, for thou shalt be a doer and preuayle. And so Dauid went his waye, and Saul turned to his place agayne.
1Sam.27.1	And Dauid sayde in his hert: I shall perishe one daye or other by the hand of Saul. Therfore is there nothing better for me, then to flee and saue my selfe in the land of the Philistines, and Saul shall cease Ꟶ seke me nomore in all the coastes of Israel, Ꟶ so shall I escape out of his hand.
1Sam.27.2	And Dauid arose, Ꟶ he Ꟶ the syxe hundred men that were wt him went vnto Achis, the sonne of Maoch, king of Geth.
1Sam.27.3	And Dauid dwelt wt Achis at Geth, both he Ꟶ his men, euery man wt his housholde, Ꟶ Dauid wt hys two wiues: Ahinoam the Iezrahelite, Ꟶ Abigail Nabals wife of Carmell.
1Sam.27.4	And it was tolde Saul, that Dauid was fleed to Geth, and he sought no moare for him.
1Sam.27.5	And Dauid sayd vnto Achis: If I haue now found grace in thine eyes, lett them geue me a place in some towne in the feldes, that I maye dwell there. For why shulde thy seruaunt dwell in the heed cytie of the kingdome wt the?
1Sam.27.6	Then Achis gaue hym zikleg the same daye, for which cause zikleg pertaineth vnto the kynges of Iuda vnto thys daye.
1Sam.27.7	And the tyme that Dauid dwelt in the contreye of the Philistines, was foure monethes, and certayne dayes.
1Sam.27.8	And Dauid Ꟶ his men went vp, and ranne vpon the Gesurites, the Gerzites Ꟶ the Amalekites: For those nacions were from the begynnyng the enhabiters of the lande, as men go to Sur, vnto the lande of Egypte.
1Sam.27.9	And Dauid smote the land, and left nether man ner woman alyue, and droue awaye the shepe, the oxen, the asses, camelles, and clothes, and retourned, and came to Achis.
1Sam.27.10	And Achis sayde: where haue ye bene a rouing this daye? And Dauid answered: Toward the south of Iuda, Ꟶ towarde the south of the Iezrahelites, Ꟶ towarde the south of the kenites.
1Sam.27.11	And Dauid saued nether man nor woman alyue ner suffred them to come to Geth, for feare (sayeth he) leste they shuld telle on vs saing so dyd Dauid Ꟶ so wylbe his maner all the while he dwelleth in the contreye of the Philistines.
1Sam.27.12	And Achis beleued Dauid saying He abhorreth his people of Israel, Ꟶ therfore he shalbe my seruaunt for euer.
1Sam.28.1	And it chaunced in those dayes, that the Philistines geathered their hoost together to warre, to fyght with Israel. And Achis sayde to Dauid: Be sure, thou shalt goo out with me to the battell, thou Ꟶ the men that are with the.
1Sam.28.2	And Dauid sayde to Achis: then thou shalt know, what thy seruaunt can do. And Achis sayde agayne to Dauid: Then I will make the keper of my heed for euer
1Sam.28.3	Samuel was then deed, Ꟶ all Israel had lamented hym, Ꟶ buryed him in Rama his awne cytie. And Saul hat put the wemen that had spretes of prophesye, Ꟶ the Sothsayers out of the land.
1Sam.28.4	And the Philistines geathered together, Ꟶ came, Ꟶ pitched in Sunem. And Saul gathered all Israel togeather, Ꟶ they pitched in Giboa:
1Sam.28.5	And when Saul saw the hoste of the Philistines, he was afrayed, Ꟶ his hert was sore astonyed.
1Sam.28.6	And whan Saul asked councell of the Lorde, the Lorde answered him not, nether hy dreames, nor by Urim nor yet by prophetes.
1Sam.28.7	Then sayd Saul vnto his seruauntes seke me a woman that hath a sprete of prophesye, that I maye go to her Ꟶ aske of her. And hys seruauntes sayde to him: Beholde, there is a woman that hath a sprete of prophesye at Endor.
1Sam.28.8	And Saul chaunged him self, and put on other rayment, Ꟶ then went he Ꟶ two men with hym, and they came to the woman by nyght. And he sayde: prophesye vnto me by the sprete, Ꟶ bring me him vp whom I shall name vnto the.
1Sam.28.9	And the woman sayde vnto hym: Beholde thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath destroyed the wemen that had prophesying spretes, Ꟶ the Sorcerars out of the lande. Wherfore then sekest thou an occasion agaynst my soule, that he maye kyll me?
1Sam.28.10	And Saul sware to her by the Lorde saying: As suerly as the Lorde lyueth, there shall no harme chaunce the for this thyng.
1Sam.28.11	Then sayd the woman: whom shall I fetche vp vnto the? He answered: Bring me vp Samuel.
1Sam.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she cryed wt a lowde voyce, and spake to Saul saying: why hast thou disceaued me? for thou art Saul.
1Sam.28.13	And the kyng sayde vnto her, be not afrayde: What seest thou? The woman sayd vnto Saul. I se goddes ascending vp out of the erth.
1Sam.28.14	He sayde vnto her agayne: what fassion is he of? She answered: there cometh vp an olde man wt a mantell vpon hym. And Saul perceaued that it was Samuel Ꟶ he stouped wt his face to the grounde, Ꟶ bowed hym selfe.
1Sam.28.15	And Samuel sayd to Saul: why hast thou vnquieted me, to make me be brought vp? Saul answered: I am sore encombred. For the Philystynes make warre agaynst me, Ꟶ God is departed from me and answereth me no more, nether by prophetes, nether by dreames. And therfore I haue called the, that thou mayest tell me, what I shall do.
1Sam.28.16	Then sayd Samuel: wherfore doest thou aske of me, whyle the Lorde is gone from the, Ꟶ is become thyne enemye?
1Sam.28.17	Truly the Lord hath done for hym selfe, euen as he spake by my hand. For the Lorde hath rent the kingdome out of thyne hande, Ꟶ geuen it thy neyboure Dauid.
1Sam.28.18	Because thou obeyedst not the voyce of the Lord, nor executedst hys fearce wrath vpon the Amaleckites, therfore hath the Lord done this vnto the this daye.
1Sam.28.19	And moreouer, the Lorde wyll delyuer Israel wt the, into the handes of the Philistines. To morowe shalt thou and thy sonnes be with me, and the Lorde shall geue the hoste of Israel into the handes of the Philistines.
1Sam.28.20	Then Saul fell streyght waye flatte on the erth a longe as he was, and was sore adread because of the wordes of Samuel. And there was no strength in hym, for he had eaten no bread all the daye and the nyght before.
1Sam.28.21	And the woman cam vnto Saul, and sawe that he was sore troubled, and sayde vnto hym: Se, thyne handmayd hath obeyed thy voyce, Ꟶ haue put my soule in my hande, and haue harkened vnto thy wordes, which thou saydest vnto me.
1Sam.28.22	Nowe therfore harken thou also vnto the voyce of thyne handmayd, and let me sett a morsell of bread before the, that thou mayest eate and gett the strength, Ꟶ then go on thy iourneye.
1Sam.28.23	He refused, and sayde: I wyll not eate. But hys seruauntes Ꟶ the woman togeather compelled him, and he hearkened vnto theyr voyce. And so he arose from the erth, and sat him on a bedd.
1Sam.28.24	The woman had a fat calfe in the house, and she hasted Ꟶ kylled it, and toke flowre Ꟶ kneded it, and dyd bake swete cakes therof,
1Sam.28.25	and brought them before Saul and before his seruauntes. And when they had eaten, they stode vp, and went awaye the same nyght.
1Sam.29.1	The Philistines were geathered togeather wt all their armyes vnto Aphec: And the Israelites pitched in Aiin, which is in Iesrahel.
1Sam.29.2	And the Lordes of the Philistines went forth wt the hundreds. Ꟶ thousandes. But Dauid Ꟶ his men came behinde wt Achis.
1Sam.29.3	Then sayde the Lords of the Philistines, what are younder Ebrues? Achis sayd vnto the Lordes of the Philistines: Is not thys Dauid the seruaunt of Saul the kynge of Israel, whych hath bene wyth me these dayes or yeres? I haue founde no fault in hym, sence he fledd vnto me vnto thys daye.
1Sam.29.4	And the Lordes of the Philistines were wroth wyth hym and sayde vnto hym: Make this felowe returne, that he maye go agayne to hys place whych thou hast appoynted hym: and let hym not go downe wyth vs to battell, lest in the battell he be an aduersarye to vs. For wherwyth coulde he better obtayne the fauoure of hys master, then wyth the heedes of these men?
1Sam.29.5	Is not thys Dauid, to whom they sange in daunses: Saul slue hys thousande, and Dauid hys ten thousande?
1Sam.29.6	Then Achis called Dauid, and sayde vnto hym: As sure as the Lorde lyueth, thou hast bene honest, and good in my syght, whan thou wentest out Ꟶ in wyth me in the hoost: neyther haue I founde euell with the, sence thou camest to me vnto thys daye: Neuerthelesse the Lordes of the Philistines fauoure the not:
1Sam.29.7	Wherfore now returne, Ꟶ go in peace, that thou displease not the Lordes of the Philistynes.
1Sam.29.8	And Dauid sayde vnto Achis: And what haue I done? what hast thou founde in thy seruaunt, as long as I haue bene wyth the vnto thys daye, that I maye not go fyght against the enemyes of my Lorde the kynge?
1Sam.29.9	Achis answered Ꟶ sayd to Dauid: I know that thou art good, Ꟶ art in my syght, as an Angell of God. Not wythstandinge the Lordes of the Philistynes haue sayde: Let hym not go vp wt vs to battell.
1Sam.29.10	Wherfore nowe ryse vp earlye in the mornyng wt thy masters seruauntes that are come to the: and when ye be vp early (as sone as ye haue lyght) departe.
1Sam.29.11	And so Dauid and his men rose vp earlye to departe in the mornynge, Ꟶ to returne into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went vp to Iezraell.
1Sam.30.1	But whan Dauid Ꟶ hys men were come to zikleg the thirde daye, the Amaleckites had russhed in vpon the south, and vpon zikleg, Ꟶ had smytten zikleg, Ꟶ burnt it wt fyre,
1Sam.30.2	Ꟶ had taken the wemen (that were therin) presoners, both small Ꟶ great: but slew not a man, saue caryed them wt them, Ꟶ went theyr wayes.
1Sam.30.3	So Dauid and hys men came to the cytie: Ꟶ beholde, it was burnt with fyre, Ꟶ their wyues, theyr sonnes and their daughters were caryed awaye.
1Sam.30.4	Then Dauid and the people that was wyth hym, lyfte vp their voyces Ꟶ wept, vntyll they could wepe no more.
1Sam.30.5	And Dauids two wiues were taken presoners also: Ahinoam the Iezrahelite, and abigail the wyfe of Nabal the Carmelite.
1Sam.30.6	And Dauid was in a shrewde combraunce: for the people entended to stone hym, because the hertes of all the people were vexed for theyr sonnes Ꟶ theyr daughters. But Dauid toke a good courage to hym in the Lorde hys God
1Sam.30.7	Ꟶ sayde to Abiathar the preste Ahimelechs sonne: I pray the, bring me the Ephod. And Abiathar brought the Ephod to Dauid.
1Sam.30.8	And Dauid asked councell at the Lorde, sayinge: shall I folowe after thys companie? and shall I ouertake them? And he answered him: folow, for thou shalt ouertake them, and recouer the praye.
1Sam.30.9	So Dauid and the syxe hundred men that were with hym, went Ꟶ cam to the riuer Besor, where a part of them abode.
1Sam.30.10	But Dauid and foure hundred men folowed: For two hundred abode behinde, beynge to werye to go ouer the ryuer Besor.
1Sam.30.11	And they founde an Egypcian in the felde, and brought hym to Dauid and gaue hym bread to eate, Ꟶ water to dryncke,
1Sam.30.12	Ꟶ gaue hym a fewe fygges Ꟶ two clousters of reasings. And when he had eaten, hys sprete cam agayne to hym: for he had eaten, no bread nor droncke no water in thre dayes Ꟶ thre nyghtes.
1Sam.30.13	And Dauid sayd vnto him: to whom belongest thou? Ꟶ whence art thou? he sayd: I am a yonge man of Egypt and seruaunt to an Amaleckite: and my master left me behynde, because it is thre dayes agone, that I fell sycke:
1Sam.30.14	we came a rouyng vpon the south of Chretus, and against Iuda, and towarde the south of Caleb. And we burnt zikleg wyth fyre.
1Sam.30.15	And Dauid sayde to hym: canst thou brynge me to this company? And he sayde: swere vnto me by God, that thou wylt nether kyll me, nor delyuer me into the handes of my master, and I will brynge the to the companye.
1Sam.30.16	And when he had brought hym thyther, beholde, they laye skatered abroade vpon the erth, eatynge Ꟶ drinckynge, Ꟶ daunsynge, because of the plenteous Ꟶ great pray, that they had caried awaye out of the land of the Philistines, Ꟶ out of the lande of Iuda.
1Sam.30.17	And Dauid layd vpon them from the euen, vntill the twilyght on the morow: so that there escaped not a man of them, saue foure hundred young men which rode awaye vpon cameles, and fledd.
1Sam.30.18	And Dauid recouered all that the Amaleckites had caried awaye, Ꟶ Dauid rescued hys two wyues:
1Sam.30.19	so that ther was no person of them lacking, small or great, sonne or daughter, or of the spoyle of all that they had take awaye, Dauid recouered them all agayne.
1Sam.30.20	And Dauid toke all the shepe, Ꟶ the oxen. And they draue them before his catell, Ꟶ sayd: this is Dauids pray.
1Sam.30.21	And Dauid came to the two hundred men, that were to werye for to folowe Dauid, whom they had made also to abyde at the ryuer Besor. And they cam to mete Dauid, Ꟶ the people that were wyth him. And when Dauid cam to the people, he saluted them.
1Sam.30.22	Then answered all the wycked Ꟶ the vnthriftes (of the men that went with Dauid) Ꟶ sayde: because they went not with vs, therfore will we geue them none of the praye, that we haue recouered, But let euery man take hys wyfe and hys chyldren: Those lett them cary awaye, and be walkynge.
1Sam.30.23	Then sayde Dauid: ye shall not do so (my brethren) wt that which the Lord hath geuen vs, Ꟶ hath preserued vs, Ꟶ delyuered the companye that came agaynst vs, into oure handes.
1Sam.30.24	For who shuld herken vnto you in thys matter? But as hys parte is that goeth downe Ꟶ fyghteth, so shall his parte be, that taryeth by the stuffe, that it maye be parted alyke.
1Sam.30.25	And so from that daye forwarde: was that made a statute Ꟶ lawe in Israel, vntyll thys daye.
1Sam.30.26	When Dauid therfore cam to zikleg he sent of the praye vnto the elders of Iuda and to hys frendes saying: se, there is a blessyng for you, of the spoyle of the enemyes of the Lorde.
1Sam.30.27	He sent to them of Bethel: to them of south Ramoth: to them of Iathir:
1Sam.30.28	to them of Aroer: to them of Sephamoth: to them of Esthemoa:
1Sam.30.29	to them of Rachel: to them of the cyties of Ierahmeel: to them of the cyties of the kenites:
1Sam.30.30	to them of Horma: to them of Borasan: to them of Athach:
1Sam.30.31	to them that are in Hebron, and in all places, wher Dauid and hys men were wont to haunt.
1Sam.31.1	The Philistines fought agaynst Israel and the men of Israel fledd awaye from the Philistines, Ꟶ fell downe wounded in mount Gilboa.
1Sam.31.2	And the Philistynes preased sore vpon Saul Ꟶ his sonnes, Ꟶ slewe Ionathas, Ꟶ Abinadab Ꟶ Melchisua Sauls sonnes.
1Sam.31.3	And whan the battell went sore agaynst Saul, the archers with bowes founde hym, Ꟶ he was sore afrayed of the archers.
1Sam.31.4	Then sayd Saul vnto his harnesberer draw out thy swerde, Ꟶ thrust me thorowe therwyth, lest these vncircumcised come, Ꟶ thrust me thorowe and make a mockynge stocke of me. But hys harnesberer wolde not, for he was sore afrayed. And Saul toke a swerde, and fell vpon it.
1Sam.31.5	And when his harnesberer sawe that Saul was deed, he fell lykewyse vpon his swerde, Ꟶ dyed wyth hym.
1Sam.31.6	And so Saul dyed, Ꟶ his thre sonnes, and his harnesberer, and all hys men that same daye togeather.
1Sam.31.7	And when the men of Israel that were on the other syde of the valeye, Ꟶ they of the other syde Iordan, heard, that the men of Israel were put to flight, and that Saul and hys sonnes were deed, they left the cyties, Ꟶ ranne awaye and the Philistines cam, and dwelt in them.
1Sam.31.8	On the morowe when the Philistines were come to spoyle them that were slayne, they founde Saul and hys thre sonnes lyenge in mount Gilboa.
1Sam.31.9	And they cut of his heed, and stripped him out of his harnesse: Ꟶ sent into the lande of the Philistines on euery syde, that they shulde publysshe it in the temple of their Idolles, and amonge the people.
1Sam.31.10	And they layed vp hys harnesse in the house of Astharoth, but they hanged vp hys body on the wall of Bethsan.
1Sam.31.11	When the enhabiters of Iabes in Gilead hearde therof, what the Philistines had done to Saul,
1Sam.31.12	they arose (as manye as were stronge men) and went all nyght and toke the body of Saul, and the bodyes of hys sonnes from the wall of Bethsan, and came to Iabes, and burnt them there
1Sam.31.13	and toke their bones and buryed them vnder a tree at Iabes, and fasted seuen dayes.
