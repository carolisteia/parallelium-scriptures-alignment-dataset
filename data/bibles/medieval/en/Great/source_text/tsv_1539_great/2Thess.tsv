2Thess.1.1	Paul and Syluanus and Timotheus. Unto the congregacyon of the Thessalonyans in God oure father, and in the Lord Iesus Christ.
2Thess.1.2	Grace be vnto you and peace from God oure father, and from the Lorde Iesus Chryst.
2Thess.1.3	We are bounde to thanke God all wayes for you brethren (as it is mete) because that youre fayth groweth excedyngly, and euery one of you swymmeth in loue towarde another betwene youre selues,
2Thess.1.4	so that we oure selues boast of you in the congregacyons of God, ouer your pacyence Ꟶ fayth in all your persecucyons Ꟶ tribulacyons, that ye suffre,
2Thess.1.5	whych is a token of the ryghtewes iudgement of God, that ye are counted worthy of the kyngdome of God, for whych ye also suffre.
2Thess.1.6	It is verely a ryghtewes thyng with God that he recompence tribulacyon to them that trouble you:
2Thess.1.7	and to you whych are troubled, rest wyth vs, when the Lorde Iesus shall shewe hym selfe from heauen with the Angels of hys power,
2Thess.1.8	wyth flaminge fyre, whych shall rendre vengeaunce vnto them that knowe not God, and that obeye not the Gospell of oure Lorde Iesus Christ
2Thess.1.9	which shalbe punysshed wyth euerlastynge damnacyon, from the presence of the Lorde, and from the glory of his power,
2Thess.1.10	when he shall come to be glorifyed in his saynctes, and to be come maruelous in all them that beleue: because oure testimonie that we had to you, was beleued euen the same daye.
2Thess.1.11	Wherfore, also we praye allwayes for you, that our God will make you worthy of this calling, Ꟶ fulfyll all delectacyon of goodnes Ꟶ the worcke of fayth, wt power:
2Thess.1.12	that the name of oure Lorde Iesus Chryst maye be glorifyed by you, and ye by hym, accordynge to the grace of oure God, and of the Lorde Iesus Christ.
2Thess.2.1	We beseche you (brethren) by the commynge of oure Lorde Iesu Christ, and in that we shall assemble vnto hym,
2Thess.2.2	that ye be not sodenly moued from youre mynde, ner be troubled, nether by sprete, nether by wordes, nor yet by letter whych shulde seme to come from vs, as though the daye of Christ were at hande.
2Thess.2.3	Let no man deceaue you by eny meanes, for the Lorde shall not come excepte ther come a departynge fyrst, and that that synfull man be opened, the sonne of perdicyon,
2Thess.2.4	whych is an aduersarye: and is exalted aboue all that is called God, or that is worshypped: so that he doth syt in the temple of God, boastynge him selfe to be God.
2Thess.2.5	Remember ye not, that when I was yet wyth you, I tolde you these thynges?
2Thess.2.6	And nowe ye know what wythholdeth: euen that he myght be vttered at hys tyme.
2Thess.2.7	For the mistery of the iniquitie doeth all readye worcke: tyll he which nowe onlye letteth, be taken out of the waye.
2Thess.2.8	And then shall that wycked be vttered, whom the Lorde shall consume with the sprete of his mouth, and shall destroye wyth the appearaunce of hys commynge
2Thess.2.9	euen hym whose commynge is after the workynge of Satan, with all lyinge power sygnes and wonders.
2Thess.2.10	and with all deceauablenes of vnryghtwesnes, amonge them that perysshe: because they receaued not the loue of the trueth, that they myght be saued.
2Thess.2.11	And therfore, God shall sende them stronge delusyon, that they shulde beleue lyes:
2Thess.2.12	that all they myght be damned, whych beleued not the trueth: but had pleasure in vnryghtewesnes.
2Thess.2.13	But we are bounde to geue thankes alwey to God for you (brethren beloued of the Lorde) for because that God hath from the begynnynge chosen you to saluacyon, thorowe sanctifyinge of the sprete, and thorow beleuing of the trueth,
2Thess.2.14	wher vnto he called you by oure Gospell, to obtayne the glorye of oure Lord Iesu Christ.
2Thess.2.15	Therfore brethren stande fast, Ꟶ kepe the ordinaunces which ye haue learned: whether it were by oure preachinge, or by Epistle.
2Thess.2.16	Oure Lorde Iesu Christ hym selfe, and God and oure father (which hath loued vs, and hath geuen vs euerlastynge consolacyon, and good hope thorowe grace)
2Thess.2.17	comforte your hertes and stablysshe you in all good sayenge and doynge.
2Thess.3.1	Furthermore brethren praye ye for vs, that the worde of God maye haue passage, and be glorifyed, as it is also with you:
2Thess.3.2	and that we maye be delyuered from vnreasonable and frowarde men. For all men haue not fayth:
2Thess.3.3	but the Lord is faythfull, whych shall stablysshe you, and preserue you from euyll.
2Thess.3.4	We haue confydence thorowe the Lord to you warde, that ye both do, Ꟶ wyll do the thynges which we commaunde you.
2Thess.3.5	And the Lord gyde youre hertes to the loue of God and to the pacyente waytynge for Chryst.
2Thess.3.6	We require you brethren by the name of oure Lorde Iesu Christ that ye wythdrawe youre selues from euery brother, that behaueth him selfe inordinatly, Ꟶ not after the institucion which he receaued of vs.
2Thess.3.7	For ye your selues know, howe ye ought to folowe vs. For we behaued not oure selues inordinatly amonge you.
2Thess.3.8	Nether toke we breed of eny man for naught: but wrought wt laboure Ꟶ sweate nyght Ꟶ daye, because we wolde not be chargeable to eny of you:
2Thess.3.9	not but that we had auctorite: but to make oure selues an ensample vnto you to folowe vs.
2Thess.3.10	For when we were wyth you, this we warned you of, that yf eny wolde not worcke, the same shulde not eate.
2Thess.3.11	For we haue, hearde saye that ther are some whych walke amonge you inordinatly, workynge not at all, but beynge busybodyes.
2Thess.3.12	Them that are soch, we commaunde and exhorte, by oure Lorde Iesu Christ, that they worcke with quietnes, and eate theyr awne breed:
2Thess.3.13	Brethren be not ye weery in well doynge.
2Thess.3.14	If eny man obey not oure sayinge, sende vs worde of him by a letter: and haue no companye with him, that he maye be ashamed.
2Thess.3.15	And count him not as an enemy: but warne him as a brother.
2Thess.3.16	The very Lorde of peace geue you peace allwayes, by all meanes. The Lord be with you all.
2Thess.3.17	The salutacyon of me Paul, with myne awne hande. This is the token in all Epistles. So I wryte.
2Thess.3.18	The grace of oure Lorde Iesus Christ be wyth you all. Amen.
