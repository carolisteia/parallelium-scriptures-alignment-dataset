Prov.0.0	¶ The prouerbes of Salomon.
Prov.1.1	The prouerbes of Salomon, the sonne of Dauid kynge of Israel:
Prov.1.2	to learne wisdome, Ꟶ to perceaue the instruccyon, and to perceaue the wordes of vnderstondynge: Ꟶ therby to receaue prudence,
Prov.1.3	ryghteousnes, iudgement and equite.
Prov.1.4	That the very simple myght haue wyt, and that the yonge men myght haue knowledge and true vnderstanding.
Prov.1.5	By hearing the wise man shall come by more wysedome: and he that is endewed wt vnderstanding
Prov.1.6	shal optayn wit to perceaue a parable, Ꟶ the interpretacyon therof, the wordes of the wyse, Ꟶ the darcke speaches of the same.
Prov.1.7	The feare of the Lorde is the begynnyng of wysdome. But fooles despyse wysdome Ꟶ instruccion.
Prov.1.8	My sonne, heare thy fathers doctrine: Ꟶ forsake not the lawe of thy mother:
Prov.1.9	for that shall bringe grace vnto thy heed, and shalbe as a cheyne about thy neck.
Prov.1.10	My sonne, consente not vnto synners,
Prov.1.11	yf they entise the, Ꟶ saye: come with vs, we will laye wayte for bloude, Ꟶ lurcke preuely for the innocent without a cause:
Prov.1.12	we shall swalowe then vp lyke the hell, Ꟶ deuoure them quycke and hole, as those that go downe into the pyt.
Prov.1.13	So shall we fynde all maner of costelye ryches, Ꟶ fill our houses wt spoyles.
Prov.1.14	Cast in thy lot among vs: Ꟶ let vs haue all one purse.
Prov.1.15	My sonne, walke not thou with them: refrayne thy fote from their waye.
Prov.1.16	For their fete runne to euell: Ꟶ are hasty to shed bloud.
Prov.1.17	But in vayn is the net laied forth before the byrdes eyes:
Prov.1.18	yee they them selues laye wayte one for anothers bloud Ꟶ one of them wold sleye another.
Prov.1.19	These are the wayes of all soch as be couetous, the one wold rauysh anothers lyfe.
Prov.1.20	Wisdome cryeth wtout, Ꟶ putteth forth her voyce in the stretes.
Prov.1.21	She calleth before the congregacyon in the open gates, Ꟶ sheweth her wordes thorow the citye, saying:
Prov.1.22	O ye children, how longe wyll ye loue childesshnes? how longe wyll the scorners delyte in scorning, Ꟶ the vnwyse be enemyes vnto knowledge?
Prov.1.23	O turne you vnto my correccion: lo, I wyll expresse my mynde vnto you, Ꟶ make you vnderstande my wordes.
Prov.1.24	I haue called, Ꟶ ye refused it: I haue stretched out my hande: Ꟶ no man regarded it:
Prov.1.25	but all my councels haue ye despised: Ꟶ set my correccion at naught.
Prov.1.26	Therfore shall I also laugh in youre destruccion, Ꟶ mocke you, when that thinge that ye feare commeth vpon you:
Prov.1.27	euen when the thynge that ye be afrayed of, falleth in sodenly lyke a storme, Ꟶ your misery lyke a tempest: yee, when trouble Ꟶ heuines commeth vpon you.
Prov.1.28	Then shal they call vpon me, but I wyll not heare: they shall seke me early, but they shall not fynde me.
Prov.1.29	And that because they hated knowledge, Ꟶ receaued not the feare of the Lorde:
Prov.1.30	but abhorred my councell, and despysed all my correccion.
Prov.1.31	Therfore shall they eate the frutes of theyr awne waye, Ꟶ be filled with their awne inuencions:
Prov.1.32	for the turnynge awaye of the vnwyse shall sleye them, and the prosperytie of fooles shalbe their awne destruccyon.
Prov.1.33	But whoso harkneth vnto me, shall dwell safely, and be sure from any feare of euyll.
Prov.2.1	My sonne, yf thou wilt receaue my wordes, and kepe my commaundementes by the,
Prov.2.2	that thou wylt enclyne thyne eare vnto wysdome, applye thyne hert then to vnderstandynge.
Prov.2.3	For yf thou cryest after wisdome, and callest for knowledge:
Prov.2.4	yf thou sekest after her as after money, and dyggest for her as for treasure,
Prov.2.5	then shalt thou vnderstande the feare of the Lorde, and fynde the knowledge of God.
Prov.2.6	For it is the Lorde that geueth wisdome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderstandynge.
Prov.2.7	He hydeth vp healthe for the ryghteous. He preserueth the welfare of the ryghteous, and defendeth them that walke syncerely:
Prov.2.8	he kepeth them in the ryght pathe, and preserueth the waye of soche as serue hym with godlynesse.
Prov.2.9	Then shalt thou vnderstande ryghteousnesse, iudment, and equyte: yee, and euery good path.
Prov.2.10	Yf wysdome entre into thyne herte, and thy soule delyte in knowledge:
Prov.2.11	then shall councell preserue the, and vnderstandynge shall kepe the.
Prov.2.12	That thou mayest be delyuered from the euell waye, and from the man that speaketh frowarde thinges.
Prov.2.13	From soche as leaue the hye strete, Ꟶ walke in the wayes of darckenesse:
Prov.2.14	which reioyse in doynge euell: and delyte in wycked thynges:
Prov.2.15	whose wayes are croked, and they frowarde in thyr pathes.
Prov.2.16	That thou mayest be deliuered also from the straunge woman, and from her that is not thyne awne: which geueth swete wordes,
Prov.2.17	forsaketh the husbande of her youth, Ꟶ forgetteth the conuenaunt of her God.
Prov.2.18	For her house is enclyned vnto death, Ꟶ her pathes vnto hell.
Prov.2.19	All they that go in vnto her come not agayn, nether take they holde of the waye of lyfe.
Prov.2.20	Therfore, walke thou in the waye of soch as be verteous, and kepe the pathes of the ryghteous.
Prov.2.21	For the iust shall dwell in the lande: and they that be perfecte shall remayne in it:
Prov.2.22	but the vngodly shalbe roted out of the lande: and the wycked doers shalbe roted out of it.
Prov.3.1	My sonne, forget not thou my lawe, but se that thyne hert kepe my commaundementes.
Prov.3.2	For they shall prolonge the dayes Ꟶ yeres of thy lyfe, and bringe the peace.
Prov.3.3	Let mercy and faythfulnes neuer go from the: bynde them about thy necke, and wryte them in the tables of thyne herte.
Prov.3.4	So shalt thou fynde fauour Ꟶ good vnderstanding, in the syght of God and men.
Prov.3.5	Put thy trust in God with all thyne herte: and leane not vnto thyne awne witte.
Prov.3.6	In all thy wayes haue respecte vnto hym: Ꟶ shall order thy goynges.
Prov.3.7	Be not wyse in thyne awne conceate: but feare the Lorde, and departe from euell:
Prov.3.8	so shall thy nauell be whole, and thy bones stronge.
Prov.3.9	Honoure the Lord wt thy substaunce: and with thy firstlinges of all thyne encrease
Prov.3.10	so shall thy barnes be fylled with plenteousnesse: and thy presses shall flowe ouer with swete wyne.
Prov.3.11	My sonne, despyse not the chastenynge of the Lorde, nether faynte when thou art rebuked of hym.
Prov.3.12	For whom the Lorde loueth, hym he chasteneth, and yet deliteth in him, euen as a father in his awne sonne.
Prov.3.13	Well is him that findeth wysdome, and opteyneth vnderstandinge:
Prov.3.14	for the getting of it is better then any marchaundise of syluer, and the profet of it is better then golde.
Prov.3.15	Wysdome is more worth then precious stones: and all the thinges that thou canst desire are not to be compared vnto her.
Prov.3.16	Upon her ryght hande is longe lyfe, and vpon her left hande is riches and honour.
Prov.3.17	Her wayes are pleasaunt wayes and all her pathes are peaceable.
Prov.3.18	She is a tree of lyfe to them that laye hold vpon her, and blessed is he that kepeth her fast.
Prov.3.19	With wysdome hath the Lorde layed the foundacion of the erth: and thorowe vnderstandinge hath he stablyshed the heauens.
Prov.3.20	Thorowe his wisdome the deapthes breake vp, and the cloudes droppe downe the dew.
Prov.3.21	My sonne, let not these thynges departe, from thyne eyes: but kepe my lawe and my councell,
Prov.3.22	that thou mayest haue the pleasure of longe lyfe and vnderstandynge: for they shalbe lyfe vnto my soule, Ꟶ grace vnto my mouth.
Prov.3.23	Then shalt thou walke safely in thy waye: and thy fote shall not stomble.
Prov.3.24	If thou slepest, thou shalt nott be afrayed: but shalt take thy rest, and slepe swetely.
Prov.3.25	Thou nedest not to be afrayed of any soden feare, nether for the vyolent russhynge in of the vngodly when it commeth.
Prov.3.26	For the Lorde shall stonde by thy syde, and kepe thy fote, that thou be not taken.
Prov.3.27	Withdrawe no good thinge from them that haue nede, so longe as thyne hand is able to do it.
Prov.3.28	Saye not vnto thy neyghboure: go thy waye, Ꟶ come agayne, to morowe wyll I geue the:
Prov.3.29	where as thou haste nowe to geue hym. Intende no hurte vnto thy neyghboure, seynge he dothe dwell in reest by the.
Prov.3.30	Stryue not lyghtely with anye man without cause, where as he hathe done the no harme.
Prov.3.31	Folowe not a wicked man, and chose none of hys wayes:
Prov.3.32	for the Lorde abhorreth the frowarde: but hys councell is amonge the ryghteous.
Prov.3.33	The curse of the Lorde is in the house of the vngodly: but he blesseth the dwellynges of the ryghteous.
Prov.3.34	As for the scornefull dothe not he laugh them to scorne? but he geueth grace vnto the lowly.
Prov.3.35	The wise shall haue honour in possession: but shame is the promocion that foles shall haue.
Prov.4.1	Heare, O ye chyldren, the fatherly exhortacyon, and take good heade, that ye maye lerne wysdome.
Prov.4.2	For I haue geuen you a good doctryne, forsake nott ye my lawe.
Prov.4.3	For when I my selfe was my fathers deare sonne, and tenderly beloued of my mother:
Prov.4.4	he taught me also, and sayde vnto me: Lett thyne herte receaue my wordes, kepe my commaundementes, and thou shalt lyue.
Prov.4.5	Get the wysdome: and get the vnderstanding: forget not the wordes of my mouth, and shrynke not from them.
Prov.4.6	Forsake her not and she shall preserue the: loue her, and she shall kepe the.
Prov.4.7	The chefe poynte of wysdome is, that thou be wyllynge to optayne wysedome: and before all thy goodes to gett the vnderstandynge.
Prov.4.8	Make moche of her and she shall promote the: Yee, yf thou embrace her, she shall brynge the vnto honoure.
Prov.4.9	She shall make the a gracyous heed, and garnysshe the with a crowne of glory.
Prov.4.10	Heare my sonne, and receaue my wordes and the yeares of thy lyfe shall be many.
Prov.4.11	I haue shewed the, the waye of wysdome, and ledd the into the ryght pathes.
Prov.4.12	So that yf thou goest therin, there shall no straytenes hynder the: and when thou runnest, thou shalte not fall.
Prov.4.13	Take fast holde of doctryne, and let her nott go: kepe her, for she is thy lyfe.
Prov.4.14	Come nott in the pathe of the vngodly: and walke nott in the waye of the wycked.
Prov.4.15	Abhorre it, and go not therin: departe asyde, and passe ouer by it.
Prov.4.16	For they cannot slepe, excepte they haue fyrst done some myschefe: nether take they anye reste, excepte they haue fyrst done some harme.
Prov.4.17	For they eate the breade of wyckednesse, and dryncke the wyne of robberye.
Prov.4.18	The pathe of the ryghtewes shyneth as the lyght, that is euer brighter and brighter vnto the perfect daye.
Prov.4.19	But the waye of the vngodly is as the darcknesse: they knowe nott where they fall.
Prov.4.20	My sonne, marcke my wordes, and enclyne thyne eare vnto my sayinges.
Prov.4.21	Let them not departe from thyne eyes: but kepe them euen in the myddest of thyne herte.
Prov.4.22	For they are lyfe vnto all those that fynde them, and health vnto all theyr bodyes.
Prov.4.23	Kepe thyne herte with all diligence, for there vpon hangeth lyfe.
Prov.4.24	Put awaye from the a frowarde mouth, Ꟶ let the lyppes of sclaunder be farre from the.
Prov.4.25	Let thyne eyes beholde the thyng that is ryght, and let thyne eye lyddes loke strayght before the.
Prov.4.26	Pondre the path of thy fete, and let all thy wayes be ordred a ryght.
Prov.4.27	Turne not asyde, nether to the ryght hande net to the lefte, but witholde thy fote from euell.
Prov.5.1	My sonne, geue hede vnto my wysdome, and bowe thyne eare vnto my prudence:
Prov.5.2	that thou mayest regarde good councel, and that thy lippes maye kepe knowledge
Prov.5.3	For the lyppes of an harlot are a droppyng hony combe and her throte is more glisterynge them oyle.
Prov.5.4	But at the last she is as bytter as wormwod, and as sharpe as a two edged swerde.
Prov.5.5	Her fete go downe vnto death and her steppes pearse thorowe vnto hell.
Prov.5.6	Parchaunse thou dwellynge with her wylt ponder the path of lyfe? so vnstedfast are her wayes, that thou canst not knowe them.
Prov.5.7	Heare me nowe therfore (O my sonnes) Ꟶ departe not from the wordes of my mouth.
Prov.5.8	Kepe thy waye farre from her, and come not nye the dores of her house.
Prov.5.9	That thou geue not thy strength vnto other, Ꟶ thy yeares to the cruell.
Prov.5.10	That other men be not fylled with thy goodes, and that thy laboures come not in a straunge house.
Prov.5.11	Yee that thou mourne not at the last (when thou hast spent thy body and lusty greane youth)
Prov.5.12	and then saye: Alas, why hated I nourtoure: why did my herte despise correccion?
Prov.5.13	Wherfore was not I obedient vnto the voyce of my teachers, and herkened not vnto them that infourmed me?
Prov.5.14	I am come almost into all misfortune, in the myddest of the multitude and congregacion.
Prov.5.15	Drincke of the water, of thyne awne well and of the ryuers that runne out of thyne awne springes.
Prov.5.16	Let thy welles flowe out abroade, that there may he ryuers of water in the stretes:
Prov.5.17	but let them be onely thyne awne, and not straungers with the.
Prov.5.18	Let thy well be blessed and be glad with the wyfe of thy youth.
Prov.5.19	Louinge is the hynde, and frendly is the Roo: let her brestes alwaye satisfye the, and holde the euer content with her loue.
Prov.5.20	My sonne, why wylt thou haue pleasure in an harlot, Ꟶ embrace the bosome, of another woman?
Prov.5.21	For euery mans wayes are open in the syght of the Lorde, and he pondreth all theyr goynges.
Prov.5.22	The wyckednesse of the vngodly shall catch hymselfe, and with the snares of hys awne synnes shall he be trapped.
Prov.5.23	He shall dye without amendement, and for hys greate folyshnesse he shall go astraye.
Prov.6.1	My sonne yf thou be suertye for thy neyghboure, and hast fastened thyne hand for another man,
Prov.6.2	thou art bounde wt thyne awne wordes, and taken with thine awne speache.
Prov.6.3	Therfore, my sonne, do thys Ꟶ thou shalt be discharged: when thou art come into thy neighbours daunger. Goo thy wayes then soone, humble thy selfe, and with thy frendes intreate thy creditour:
Prov.6.4	let not thyne eyes slepe, ner thyne eye lyddes slomber.
Prov.6.5	Saue thy selfe as a doo from the hande of the huntre, Ꟶ as a byrde from the hande of the fouler.
Prov.6.6	Go to the Emmet (thou slougard) consydre herwayes, Ꟶ lerne to be wyse.
Prov.6.7	She hath no guyde, no ouersear nor ruler:
Prov.6.8	yet in the Sommer she prouideth her meate, and gathereth her fode to gether in the haruest.
Prov.6.9	Howe longe wylt thou slepe, thou slougysh man? When wylt thou aryse out of thy slepe?
Prov.6.10	Yee slepe on styll a lytle, slomber a lytle, foulde thyne handes together yet a lytle, that thou mayest slepe:
Prov.6.11	so shall pouertye come vnto the as on that trauayleth by the waye, Ꟶ necessytelke a weapened man.
Prov.6.12	An vngodly person, a wycked man goeth with a frowarde mouth
Prov.6.13	he wyncketh with his eyes, he tokeneth with hys fete, he poynteth with hys fyngers,
Prov.6.14	he is euer ymagenynge myschefe, and frowardnesse in hys herte, Ꟶ causeth discorde.
Prov.6.15	Therfore shall hys destruccyon come hastly vpon him, sodenly shall he be all to broken, and not be healed.
Prov.6.16	These syxe thynges doth the Lord hate, and the seuenth he vtterly abhorreth:
Prov.6.17	A proude looke a lyinge tonge, handes that shed innocent bloude,
Prov.6.18	an herte that goeth aboute wyth wycked ymaginacyons fete that be swyfte in rennynge to do myschefe,
Prov.6.19	a false wytnesse that bringeth vp lyes, and soche one as soweth discorde amonge brethren.
Prov.6.20	My sonne, kepe thy fathers commaundement, and forsake not the lawe of thy mother.
Prov.6.21	Put them vp together in thyne herte, and bynde them aboute thy neck.
Prov.6.22	That they may leade the where thou goest, preserue the when thou art a slepe, and that when thou awakest, thou mayest talke of them.
Prov.6.23	For the commaundement is a lanterne, and the lawe a lyght: yee chastenyng and nourtoure is the waye of lyfe
Prov.6.24	that they may kepe the from the euell woman, and from the flatteryng tonge of the harlote:
Prov.6.25	that thou lust not after her beauty in thyne herte, and lest thou be taken with her fayre lookes.
Prov.6.26	An harlot wyll make a man to begge his bread, and a woman wyll hunt for the precyous lyfe.
Prov.6.27	Maye a man take fyre in hys bosome and hys clothes not be brent?
Prov.6.28	Or can one go vpon hote coales, and hys fete not be hurte?
Prov.6.29	Euen so, whosoeuer goeth into his neyghbours wyfe, and toucheth her, cannot be vngylty.
Prov.6.30	Men do not vtterly despyse a thefe that stealeth to satisfye hys soule, when he is hungry:
Prov.6.31	but yf he maye be gotten, he restoreth agayne seuen tymes as moche, or els he maketh recompense with all the good of hys house.
Prov.6.32	But whoso committeth aduoutry with a woman, he is a foole and bryngeth his lyfe to destruction.
Prov.6.33	He getteth hym selfe also shame and dishonour, soche as shall neuer be put out.
Prov.6.34	For the gelousy and wrath of the man wyll not be intreated,
Prov.6.35	no though thou woldest offre him great gyftes to make amendes, he will not receaue them.
Prov.7.1	My sonne, kepe my wordes, Ꟶ laye vp my commaundementes by the.
Prov.7.2	Kepe my commaundementes and my lawe, euen as the apple of thyne eye, and thou shalt lyue.
Prov.7.3	Bynde them vpon thy fyngers, and wryte them in the table of thyne hert.
Prov.7.4	Saye vnto wysdome: thou art my syster, and call vnderstandynge thy kynswoman:
Prov.7.5	that they maye kepe the from the straunge woman, and from the harlot which geueth swete wordes.
Prov.7.6	For out of the wyndowe of my house I loked thorowe the latysse,
Prov.7.7	Ꟶ behelde the symple people: and amonge other yonge folkes I spyed one yonge foole,
Prov.7.8	goinge ouer the stretes, by the corner in the waye towarde the harlottes house,
Prov.7.9	in the twylight of the euenynge, when it beganne nowe to be nyght Ꟶ darcke.
Prov.7.10	And beholde, there mett hym a woman wt open tokens of an harlot, onely her herte was hyde,
Prov.7.11	She was full of loude wordes, Ꟶ redy to daly: whose fete coulde not abyde in the house,
Prov.7.12	nowe is the without, now in the stretes, and layeth abayte in euery corner,
Prov.7.13	she caught the yongeman, kyssed hym, and was not ashamed, sayinge:
Prov.7.14	I had a vowe of peace offerynges to paye, and thys daye I perfourme it.
Prov.7.15	Therfore came I forth to mete the, that I myght seke thy face, and so I haue founde the.
Prov.7.16	I haue deckte my bed with couerynges and clothes of Egypte.
Prov.7.17	My bed haue I made to smell of Mirre, Aloes, and Cynamon.
Prov.7.18	Come lett vs ly together, and take oure pleasure tyll it be daye lyght: and we wyll enioye the pleasures of loue.
Prov.7.19	For the good man is not at home, he is gone farre of.
Prov.7.20	He hath taken the bagge of moneye with hym: And will retourne home at the appoynted solempne feste?
Prov.7.21	Thus with many swete wordes she ouercame him, and with her flatterynge lyppes she entysed hym
Prov.7.22	sodenlye to folowe her: as it were an oxe led to the slaughter, Ꟶ lyke as it were a foole that laugheth when he goeth to the stockes, to be punyshed,
Prov.7.23	so longe tyll she had wounded hys lyuer with her dart: lyke as yf a byrde hasted to the snare, not knowynge that the parell of hys lyfe lyeth ther vpon.
Prov.7.24	Heare me nowe therfore, O my chyldren, and marcke the wordes of my mouth.
Prov.7.25	Let not thyne herte wandre in her wayes, and be not thou disceaued in her pathes.
Prov.7.26	For many one hath she wounded and cast downe, yee many a stronge man hath bene slayne by the meanes of her.
Prov.7.27	Her houses are the waye vnto hell, and brynge men downe into the chambers of death.
Prov.8.1	Doth not wysdome crye? doth not vnderstandynge put forth her voyce?
Prov.8.2	Standeth she not in the hye places in the stretes and wayes?
Prov.8.3	doth she not crye before the whole cytie, and in the gates where men go out and in?
Prov.8.4	It is you, O ye men (sayeth she) whom I call: Unto (the chyldren of men) do I lyft vp my voyce.
Prov.8.5	Take hede vnto knowledge O ye ignoraunt be wyse in herte, O ye foles.
Prov.8.6	Geue eare, for I wyll speake of greate matters, and open my lyppes to tell thynges that be ryght.
Prov.8.7	For my throte shalbe talkynge of the trueth and my lyppes abhorre vngodlynesse.
Prov.8.8	All the wordes of my mouth are righteous, there is no frowarnedsse nor falshede therin.
Prov.8.9	They are all playne to soche as wyll vnderstande, and ryght to them that fynde knowledge.
Prov.8.10	Receaue my doctryne, and not syluer: and my knowledge, more then fyne golde.
Prov.8.11	For wysdome is more worth then precious stones, yee all thynges that thou canst desyre, maye not be compared vnto it.
Prov.8.12	I wysdome haue my dwellynge with knowledge, and prudent councell is myne awne.
Prov.8.13	The feare of the Lorde abhorreth wyckednesse, pryde dysdayne, and the euell waye: and a mouth that speaketh wycked thynges, I vtterly abhorre.
Prov.8.14	I can geue councell, and I conferre thinges: I haue vnderstanding, I haue strength.
Prov.8.15	Thorowe me, kynges reygne: thorowe me counselars make iust lawes.
Prov.8.16	Thorowe me, do prynces beare rule, and all iudges of the earth execute iudgement.
Prov.8.17	I am louynge vnto those that loue me: and they that seke me early shall fynde me.
Prov.8.18	Ryches and honoure are with me, ye excellent goodes and ryghteousnes.
Prov.8.19	My frute is better then golde and precious stone, and myne encrease more worth then fyne syluer.
Prov.8.20	I wyll guyde the in the waye of ryghteousnes, and in the strete of iudgement.
Prov.8.21	That I maye sende prosperite to those that loue me, and to encrease their treasure.
Prov.8.22	The Lorde him selfe had me in possessyon in the begynnynge of his wayes, or euer he beganne his worckes a fore tyme.
Prov.8.23	I haue bene ordened from euerlastynge, and from the begynnynge or euer the earth was made.
Prov.8.24	When I was borne, there were nether depthes nor sprynges of water.
Prov.8.25	Before the foundacyons of the mountaynes were layed, yee before all hylles was I borne.
Prov.8.26	The earth and all that is vpon the earth was not yet made, no not the grounde it selfe.
Prov.8.27	For when he made the heauens, I was present: when he sett vp the depthes in ordre,
Prov.8.28	when he hanged the cloudes aboue: when he fastened the sprynges of the depe:
Prov.8.29	When he shut the see within certayne bowndes, that the waters shulde not go ouer their marckes that he commaunded. When he layed the foundacyons of the earth
Prov.8.30	I was with him, ordrynge all thynges: delytinge dayly, and reioysynge all waye before him.
Prov.8.31	As for the rounde compase of thys worlde, I make it ioyfull: for my delyte is to be amonge the chyldren of men.
Prov.8.32	Therfore herken vnto me, O ye chyldren, blessed are they that kepe my wayes.
Prov.8.33	O geue eare vnto nurtoure, be wyse, and refuse it not.
