2Tim.0.0	¶ The seco{n}de Epistle of Saynct Paul the Apostle vnto Timothe.
2Tim.1.1	Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ, by the wyll of God, accordynge to the promes of lyfe which is in Christ Iesu.
2Tim.1.2	To Timothe hys beloued sonne. Grace mercy and peace from God the father, Ꟶ from Iesu Christ our Lorde.
2Tim.1.3	I thanke God, whom I serue from myne elders with pure conscience, that without anye ceasynge I make mencyon of the in my prayers nyght and daye,
2Tim.1.4	desyringe to se the, myndefull of thy teares: so that I am fylled with ioye,
2Tim.1.5	when I call to remembraunce the vnfayned fayth that is in the, which dwelt fyrst in thy graundmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunica: Ꟶ I am assured that it dwelleth in the also.
2Tim.1.6	Wherfore I warne the that thou stere vp the gyfte of God which is in the by the puttynge on of my handes.
2Tim.1.7	For God hath not geuen to vs the sprete of feare: but of power, and of loue, and of sobrenes.
2Tim.1.8	Be not thou therfore ashamed of the testimony of oure Lorde, nether be ashamed of me whych am his presoner: but suffre thou aduersytie with the Gospell, accordynge to the power of God,
2Tim.1.9	which saued vs, and called vs with an holy callynge, not accordynge to oure dedes, but accordynge to his awne purpose Ꟶ grace, whych was geuen vs thorowe Christ Iesu (before the worlde beganne)
2Tim.1.10	but is nowe declared openly by the appearynge of oure sauyour Iesu Christ whych hath put awaye deeth, and hath brought lyfe and immortalite vnto lyght thorowe the Gospell,
2Tim.1.11	whervnto I am apoynted, a preacher Ꟶ Apostle, and a teacher of the Gentyls:
2Tim.1.12	for the whych cause I also suffre these thynges. Neuerthelesse, I am not ashamed. For I knowe, and am sure, that he (in whom I haue put my trust) is able to kepe that whych I haue committed to hys kepynge, agaynst that daye.
2Tim.1.13	Se that thou haue the ensample of the holsome wordes, whych thou hast hearde of me with fayth and loue that is in Christ Iesu.
2Tim.1.14	That good thynge, whych was committed to thy kepynge, holde fast thorowe the holy goost, which dwelleth in vs.
2Tim.1.15	This thou knowest, howe that all they which are in Asia, be turned from me: of whych sorte are Phigelus and Hermogenes.
2Tim.1.16	The Lorde geue mercye vnto the housholde of Onesyphorus for he ofte refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chayne:
2Tim.1.17	but when he was at Rome, he sought me out very diligently, Ꟶ founde me.
2Tim.1.18	The Lorde graunt vnto hym that he maye fynde mercye with the Lorde at that daye. And in howe many thynges he ministred vnto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
2Tim.2.1	Thou therfore my sonne, be stronge in the grace (that is thorow Christ Iesu)
2Tim.2.2	and in the thynges that thou hast hearde of me by many wytnesses. The same commytte thou to faythfull men, which shalbe apte to teach other also.
2Tim.2.3	Thou therfore suffre afflyccyons as a good soudier of Iesu Chryst.
2Tim.2.4	No man that warreth, entanglyth hym selfe wyth worldly busynes, and that because he maye please hym, whych hath chosen hym to be a soudier.
2Tim.2.5	And though a man stryue for a mastery, yet is he not crowned, except he stryue laufully
2Tim.2.6	The husbandman that laboureth, must fyrst receaue of the frutes.
2Tim.2.7	Consyder what I saye. The Lorde geue the vnderstandynge in all thynges.
2Tim.2.8	Remember that Iesus Christ of the sede of Dauid, rose agayne from deeth according to my Gospell,
2Tim.2.9	wherin I suffre trouble as an euyll doar, euen vnto bondes. But the worde of God was not bounde.
2Tim.2.10	Therfore I suffre all thynges, for the electes sakes, that they myght also obtayne the saluacion, which is in Christ Iesu, with eternall glory.
2Tim.2.11	It is a true sayinge for yf we be deed wt hym, we shall also lyue wyth hym.
2Tim.2.12	If we be pacient, we shall also raygne wyth hym. If we denye hym, he also shall denye vs.
2Tim.2.13	If we beleue not, yet abydeth he faythfull. He cannot denye hym selfe.
2Tim.2.14	Of these thinges put them in remembraunce, and testifye before the Lorde, that they folowe no contencyous wordes: which are to no profet, but to the peruertynge of the hearers.
2Tim.2.15	Study to shewe thy selfe laudable vnto God, a workman that nedeth not to be a shamed distributynge the worde of trueth iustly.
2Tim.2.16	As for vngoostly vanyties of voyces, passe thou ouer them. For they wyll encreace vnto greater vngodlynes,
2Tim.2.17	Ꟶ theyr wordes shall fret euen as doeth the disease of a cancre: of whose nombre is. Hymeneus and Philetus,
2Tim.2.18	whych (as concernynge the trueth) haue erred, sayinge, that the resurreccyon is past all redy, and do destroye the fayth of some.
2Tim.2.19	But the sure grounde of God standeth still, and hath this seale: the Lorde knoweth them that are hys. And let euery man that calleth on the name of Christ, departe from iniquite.
2Tim.2.20	Not wythstandynge in a greate house are not onely vesseles of golde and of syluer: but also of wood and of erthe: some for honoure, and some vnto dyshonoure.
2Tim.2.21	Yf a man therfore pourge him selfe from such men, he shalbe a vessel sanctifyed vnto honoure, mete for the vses of the Lorde, and prepared vnto all good workes.
2Tim.2.22	Lustes of youth auoyde, but folowe ryghtwesnes, fayth, loue and peace, with them that call on the Lorde with a pure herte.
2Tim.2.23	Folysshe and vnlearned questions put from the, knowinge, that they do but gendre stryfe.
2Tim.2.24	The seruaunt of the Lorde must not stryue: but be gentle vnto all men apte to teach, and one that can suffre
2Tim.2.25	the euyll with meaknes, and can informe them that resyst yf that God at eny tyme wyll geue them repentaunce, for to knowe the trueth:
2Tim.2.26	and that they maye come to them selues agayne out of the snare of the deuyll, which are holden captiue of hym at hys wyll.
2Tim.3.1	Thys knowe, that in the last dayes shall come parelous tymes.
2Tim.3.2	For men shalbe louers of theyr awne selues, coueteous, boasters, proude, cursed speakers, dysobedient to fathers and mothers, vnthankfull, vngodly,
2Tim.3.3	vnkynde, trucebreakers, falseaccusars, riatours, fearce, despisers of them which are good,
2Tim.3.4	traytours, heady, hye mynded, gredy vpon volupteousnes more then the louers of God,
2Tim.3.5	hauynge a symilitude of godlynesse, but haue denyed the power therof: and soch abhorre.
2Tim.3.6	For of thys sorte are they, which entre into houses, and bringe into bondage wemen laden wt synne, which wemen are led with diuers lustes,
2Tim.3.7	euer learnynge, and neuer able to come vnto the knowledge of the trueth.
2Tim.3.8	As Iannes Ꟶ Iambres withstode Moses, euen so do these also resyst the trueth: men they are of corrupt myndes, and lewde as concerninge the fayth:
2Tim.3.9	but they shall preuayle no lenger. For their madnes shalbe vttered vnto all men euen as theirs was.
2Tim.3.10	But thou hast sene the experience of my doctryne, fassyon of lyuinge, purpose, fayth, longe sufferynge, loue, pacience,
2Tim.3.11	persecucyons, and affliccyons whych happened vnto me at Antioche, at Iconium, and at Lystra: which persecutions I suffered paciently. And from them all, the Lorde delyuered me.
2Tim.3.12	Yee, and all they that wyll lyue godly in Christ Iesu shall suffre persecutyon.
2Tim.3.13	But the euyll men Ꟶ disceauers shall wexe worsse and worsse, whill they deceaue and are deceaued them selues.
2Tim.3.14	But continue thou in the thynges which thou hast learned, which also were commytted vnto the, knowinge of whom thou hast learned them,
2Tim.3.15	and for as moch also as of a chylde thou hast knowen the holy scriptures which are able to make the lerned vnto saluacyon thorow the fayth which is in Christ Iesu.
2Tim.3.16	All scripture geuen by inspiracyon of God, is proffitable to teache, to improue, to amende and to instruct in ryghtewesnes,
2Tim.3.17	that the man of God maye be perfecte Ꟶ prepared vnto all good workes.
2Tim.4.1	I Testifye therfore before God, Ꟶ before the Lord Iesu Christ, which shall iudge the quicke and deed at hys apearinge in hys kyngdom,
2Tim.4.2	preache thou the worde, be feruent, in season Ꟶ oute of season. Improue, rebuke, exhorte wt all longe sufferynge and doctryne.
2Tim.4.3	For the tyme will come, when they shall not suffer wholsome doctryne: but after their awne lustes shall they (whose eares ytche) gett them an heepe of teachers,
2Tim.4.4	and shall withdrawe their eares from the trueth, and shalbe turned vnto fables.
2Tim.4.5	But watche thou in all thynges, suffre affliccyons, do the worke thorowlye of an Euangelist, fulfyll thyne offyce vnto the vtmost.
2Tim.4.6	For I am nowe ready to be offered, and the tyme of my departynge, is at hande.
2Tim.4.7	I haue fought a good fyght, I haue fulfylled my course, I haue kept the fayth.
2Tim.4.8	From hence forth ther is layde vp for me a crowne of ryghtewesnes, which the Lorde (that is a ryghteous iudge) shall geue me at that daye: not to me onely, but vnto all them also that loue his comminge.
2Tim.4.9	Do thy dyligence that thou mayest come shortly vnto me.
2Tim.4.10	For Demas hath forsaken me, and loueth thys present worlde, and is departed vnto Thessalonica. Crescens is gone to Galacia, Tytus vnto Dalmacia.
2Tim.4.11	Onely Lucas is with me. Take Marke, and bringe him with the, for he is proffitable vnto me for the minystracyon.
2Tim.4.12	And Tychycus haue I sent to Ephesus.
2Tim.4.13	The cloke that I lefte at Troada with Carpus, (when thou commest) bringe with the, and the bokes, but specially the partchement.
2Tim.4.14	Alexander the coppersmyth dyd me moch euyll: the Lorde rewarde hym accordynge to hys dedes,
2Tim.4.15	of whom be thou ware also. For he hath greatly wythstande oure wordes.
2Tim.4.16	At my fyrst answerynge, no man assisted me, but all forsoke me. I praye God, that it maye not be layde to their charges:
2Tim.4.17	Not wythstandynge the Lorde, assysted me, and strengthed me, that by me the preachynge shulde be fulfylled to the vtmost, and that all the Gentyls shulde heare. And I was delyuered out of the mouth of the lyon.
2Tim.4.18	And the Lorde shall delyuer me from all euyll doynge, and shall kepe me vnto hys heuenly kyngdom. To whom be prayse for euer and euer. Amen.
2Tim.4.19	Salute Prisea and Aquila Ꟶ the housholde of Onesiphorus,
2Tim.4.20	Erastus abode at Corinthum. Trophunus haue I lefte at Myletum sycke.
2Tim.4.21	Do thy diligence, that thou mayest come before winter. Eubolus gretith the, and so doth Pudens, and Lynus, Claudia, and all the brethren.
2Tim.4.22	The Lorde Iesus Christ be with thy sprete. Grace be with you: Amen.
