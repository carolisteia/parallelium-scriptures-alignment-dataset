Joel.0.0	¶ The booke of Ioel the prophete,
Joel.1.1	Thys is the worde of the Lorde, that came vnto Ioell the sonne of Phatuel.
Joel.1.2	Heare, O yee elders: pondre this well, all ye that dwell in the lande: yf euer there happened soch a thinge in your dayes, or in the dayes of youre fathers.
Joel.1.3	Tell youre chyldren of it, and lett them shewe it vnto their chyldren, and so they to certifye theyr posteryte therof.
Joel.1.4	Loke what the caterpyller hath lefte, that hath the greshoper eaten vp: what the greshoper lefte, that hath the locuste eaten vp: and what the locuste hath left, that hath the blastynge consumed.
Joel.1.5	Wake vp ye dronckardes, and wepe: mourne all ye wynesuppers, because of youre swete wyne, for it shall be taken awaye from youre mouth.
Joel.1.6	Yee, a myghtye and an innumerable people shall come vp into my lande: these haue teeth lyke the teeth of lyons, and chaftbones lyke the lyonesses.
Joel.1.7	They shall make my vyneyarde waste, they shall pyll of the darckes of my fyggetrees, strype them bare, cast them awaye, and make the braunches whyte.
Joel.1.8	Make thy moone as a vyrgin doth that gyrdeth her selfe with sacke, because of her bryde grome.
Joel.1.9	For the meate and drynckoffringe shalbe taken awaye from the house of the Lorde, and the prestes the Lordes minysters shall mourne.
Joel.1.10	The felde shalbe wasted, the lande shalbe in a myserable case: for the corne shalbe destroyed, the swete wyne shall come to confusyon, and the oyle vtterly desolate.
Joel.1.11	The housbandmen and the wyne gardeners shall loke pyteously and make lamentacyon, for the wheate, wyne and barly, and because the haruest vpon the felde is so clene destroyed.
Joel.1.12	The grapegatherers shall make greate mone, when the vyneyarde and fyggetrees be so vtterly wasted. Yee, all the pomgarnettes, palmetrees, apletrees, Ꟶ the other trees of the felde shall wyther awaye. Thus the mery cheare of the chyldren of men, shall come to confusyon.
Joel.1.13	Gyrde you, and make youre mone, O ye prestes, mourne ye minystres of the aulter: goo your waye in, and slepe in sack cloth, O ye officiers of my God: for the meat Ꟶ drinkofferinge shall be taken awaye from the house of youre God.
Joel.1.14	Proclayme a fastinge, call the congregacyon, gather the elders and all the inhabitours of the lande together into the house of the Lorde your God, and crye vnto the Lorde:
Joel.1.15	alas, alas for thys daye. And why? the daye of the Lorde is at hande, and cometh as a destroyer from the almyghtye.
Joel.1.16	Shall not the meates be taken awaye before oure eyes, the myrth also and ioye from the house of our God?
Joel.1.17	The sede shall peryshe in the grounde, the garners shall lye waste, the flores shalbe broken downe, for the corne shall be destroyed.
Joel.1.18	O what a syghynge make the kyne? the bullockes are very euell lykynge, because they haue no pasture: and the shepe are famysshed awaye.
Joel.1.19	O Lorde, to the wyll I crye: for the fyre hath consumed the goodly pastures of the wyldernes, and the flame hath brent vp all the trees of the felde.
Joel.1.20	Yee, the wylde beastes crye also vnto the: for the water riuers are dryed vp, and the fyre hath consumed the pastures of the wyldernesse.
Joel.2.1	Blowe out the trompette in Syon, and crye vpon my holy hyll, that all soche as dwell in the lande, maye tremble at it: for the daye of the Lorde commeth, and is harde at hande:
Joel.2.2	a darcke daye, a gloomynge daye, a cloudy daye, yee, and a stormy daye, lyke as the mornynge spredeth out vpon the hylles. Namely, a greate and myghtye people: soch as haue not bene sence the beginninge, nether shall be after them for euermore.
Joel.2.3	Before him shall be a consumynge fyre, and behynde him a burnynge flame. The lande shalbe as a garden of pleasure before him, but behinde him shall it be a very waste wyldernesse, and there is no man, that shall escape hym:
Joel.2.4	They are to loke vpon lyke barbed horses, Ꟶ runne lyke horsmen.
Joel.2.5	They skippe vp vpon the hylles, as it were the sounde of charettes: as the flame of fyre that consumeth the strawe, and as a myghty people redy to the batayll.
Joel.2.6	The folke shalbe afrayed of hym, all faces shalbe as blacke as a pot:
Joel.2.7	These shall runne lyke gyauntes, and leape ouer the walles lyke men of warre. Euery man in his goinge shall kepe hys araye, and not goo out of hys path.
Joel.2.8	There shall not one driue another, but eche shall kepe his awne waye. They shall breake in at the wyndowes, Ꟶ not be hurte:
Joel.2.9	They shall come into the cytie, Ꟶ runne vpon the walles. They shall clyme vp vpon the houses, and slyppe in at the wyndowes lyke a thefe.
Joel.2.10	The earth shall quake before hym, yee, the heauens shalbe moued. The sunne Ꟶ the moone shall be darckened, and the starres shall withdrawe theyr shyne.
Joel.2.11	The Lord shall shewe hys voyce before hys hooste, for his hoost is greate, stronge, and myghtye to fulfyll hys commaundement. Thys is that greate and maruelous fearfull daye of the Lorde. And who is able to abyde it?
Joel.2.12	Nowe therfore sayeth the Lorde. Turne you vnto me with all your hertes, with fastinge, wepynge and mournynge,
Joel.2.13	rente your hertes, and not youre clothes. Turne you vnto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and mercyfull, longe sufferynge and of great compassyon: and redy to pardone wyckednes.
Joel.2.14	Then (no doute) he also shall turne, and forgeue, and after his chastenynge, he shall lett your increase remayne, for meat and drinckoffrynges vnto the Lord your God?
Joel.2.15	Blowe out with the trompette in Syon, proclayme a fastynge, call the congregacyon,
Joel.2.16	and gather the people together: warne the congregacyon, gather the elders, brynge the chyldren Ꟶ sucklynges together. Lett the brydegrome go forth of his chambre, and the bryde out of her closet.
Joel.2.17	Lett the prestes serue the Lorde betwyxte the porch and the aulter, wepinge and sayinge: be fauourable, O Lorde, be fauourable vnto thy people: let not thyne heritage be brought to soch confusyon, lest the Heathen be lordes therof. Wherfore shulde they saye amonge the Heathen: where is nowe theyr God.
Joel.2.18	Then shall the Lorde be gelous ouer his lande, and spare hys people:
Joel.2.19	yee, the Lorde shall answere, and saye vnto his people: Beholde, I wyll sende you corne, wyne Ꟶ oyle, so that ye shall haue plenty of them: and I will nomore geue you ouer to be a reprofe amonge the Heathen.
Joel.2.20	Agayne, as for him of the north, I shall dryue him farre from you: and shute him out into a drye Ꟶ waste lande, his face towarde the east see, and his hynder partes towarde the vtmost see. The styncke of him shall go vp, and his fylthy corrupcyon shall fall vpon him selfe, because he hath dealt so proudly.
Joel.2.21	Feare not (O lande) but be glad and reioyse, for the Lorde will do great thinges.
Joel.2.22	Be not ye afrayed nether (O ye beastes of the felde) for the pastures shalbe grene, and the trees shall beare their frute: the fyggetrees and vyneyardes shall geue theyr increase.
Joel.2.23	Be glad then (O ye chyldren of Syon) and reioyse in the Lorde youre God, for he hath geuen you a teacher of ryghteousnesse: Ꟶ he it is that shall sende you downe shouers of rayne, early and late in the fyrst moneth:
Joel.2.24	so that the garners shalbe full of corne, and the presses plenteous in wyne and oyle.
Joel.2.25	And as for the yeares that the gresshoper, locuste, blastynge, and caterpyller (my greate hoost, which I sent amonge you) haue eaten vp, I shall restore them to you agayne.
Joel.2.26	so that ye shall haue ynough to eate, Ꟶ be satisfyed: and prayse the name of the Lorde your God, that so maruelously hath dealte with you. And my people shall neuer be confounded any more.
Joel.2.27	Ye shall well knowe, that I am in the myddest of Israell, and that I am youre God: yee, and that there is none other, and my people shall no more be brought to confusion.
Joel.2.28	After this, will I poure out my sprete vpon all flesh: and your sonnes and your daughters shall prophecy: your olde men shall dreame dreames, and youre yonge men shall se visyons,
Joel.2.29	yee, in those dayes I will poure out my sprete vpon seruauntes and maydens.
Joel.2.30	I will shewe wonders in heauen aboue and tokens in the earth beneth: bloude and fyre, and the vapoure of smoke.
Joel.2.31	The sunne shalbe turned into darckenes, and the mone into bloude: before the greate Ꟶ notable daye of the Lord come.
Joel.2.32	And the tyme shall come, that whosoeuer calleth on the name of the Lorde, shalbe saued. For vpon the mounte Syon and at Ierusalem, there shalbe a saluacyon, lyke as the Lorde hath promysed: yee, and amonge the other remnaunt, whom the Lorde shall call.
Joel.3.1	For take hede: in those dayes and at the same tyme, when I turne agayne the captiuyte of Iuda and Ierusalem:
Joel.3.2	I shall gather all people together, and brynge them in the valley of Iosaphat: and there will I reason with them: because of my people and heritage of Israel: whom they haue scatred about in the nacyons: and parted my lande:
Joel.3.3	yee, they haue cast lottes for my people, the yonge men haue they set in the bordel house, Ꟶ solde the damsels for wyne, that they myght haue to drincke.
Joel.3.4	Thou Tirus and Sidon and all ye borders of the Philistines: what haue ye to do wt me? Will ye defye me? well, yf ye will nedes defye me, I shall recompence you, euen vpon your heade, Ꟶ the ryght worthely:
Joel.3.5	for ye haue taken awaye my syluer and golde, my fayre and goodly Iewels, and brought them into your goddes houses.
Joel.3.6	The chyldren also of Iuda and Ierusalem haue ye solde vnto the Grekes, that ye myght brynge them farre from the borders of their awne countrees.
Joel.3.7	Beholde therfore, I wyll rayse them out of the place, where ye haue solde them, and will rewarde you euen vpon your head.
Joel.3.8	Your sonnes and youre daughters wyll I sell thorowe the handes of the chyldren of Iuda, and so they shall geue them forth to sell, vnto them of Saba, a people of a farre countre: for the Lorde him selfe hath sayde it.
Joel.3.9	Crye oute these thynges amonge the Gentyles, proclayme warre, wake vp the gyauntes, let them drawe nye, let them come vp all the lusty warryours of them.
Joel.3.10	Make you sweardes of your plowshares, and speares of youre sycles Ꟶ sythes. Let the weake man saye: I am stronge.
Joel.3.11	Mustre you, Ꟶ come, all ye Heathen rounde about: gather you together, there shall the Lord laye all thy gyauntes to the grounde.
Joel.3.12	Lett the people aryse, Ꟶ get them to the valley of Iosaphat for there will I syt, Ꟶ iudge all Heathen rounde about
Joel.3.13	Laye to your sythes, for the haruest is rype: come, get you downe: the wyne presse is full, yee, the wynepresses runne ouer, for their wickednes is waxen greate.
Joel.3.14	In the valley appoynted, there shalbe many, many people: for the daye of the Lorde is nye in the valley appoynted.
Joel.3.15	The sunne Ꟶ moone shalbe darckened, Ꟶ the starres shall withdrawe their lyght.
Joel.3.16	The Lorde shall roare out of Syon, and crye out of Ierusalem, that the heauens and the earth shall quake withall. But the Lorde shalbe a defence vnto hys awne people, and a refuge for the chyldren of Israel.
Joel.3.17	Thus shall ye knowe, that I the Lorde youre God dwell vpon my holy mounte of Syon. Then shall Ierusalem be holy, Ꟶ there shall no straungers go thorowe her any more.
Joel.3.18	Then shall the mountaynes drope swete wyne, and the hylles shall flowe with mylcke. All the ryuers of Iuda shall haue water ynough, and out of the Lordes house there shall flowe a spring, to water the broke of Sitim:
Joel.3.19	but Egypte shalbe layed waste, and Edom shalbe desolate: because they haue dealte so cruelly with the chyldren of Iuda, and shed innocent bloude in theyr lande.
Joel.3.20	Agayne, Iuda shalbe inhabited for euermore, Ꟶ Ierusalem from generacyon to generacyon:
Joel.3.21	for I will not leaue their bloude vnauenged. And the Lorde shall dwell in Syon.
Joel.0.0	¶ The ende of the prophecye of Ioel.
