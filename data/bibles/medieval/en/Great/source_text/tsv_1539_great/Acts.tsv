Acts.0.0	¶ The Actes of the Apostles.
Acts.1.1	In the former treatyse (Deare Theophylus) we haue spoken of all that Iesus beganne to do and teache,
Acts.1.2	vntyll the daye in which he was taken vp, after that he, thorow the holy goost, had geuen commaundementes vnto the Apostles, whom he had chosen:
Acts.1.3	to whom also he shewed hym selfe alyue after hys passion (and that by many tokens) appearynge vnto them fourtye dayes, and speakynge of the kyngdome of God,
Acts.1.4	and gathered them together, and commaunded them, that they shulde not departe from Ierusalem: but to wayte for the promys of the father wherof (sayeth he) ye haue hearde of me.
Acts.1.5	For Iohn truly baptysed with water, but ye shalbe baptysed with the holy goost after these feawe dayes.
Acts.1.6	When they therfore were come together, they asked of him, sayinge: Lorde, wilt thou at this tyme, restore agayne the kyngdome to Israel?
Acts.1.7	And he sayde vnto them: It is not for you to knowe the tymes, or the seasons, which the father hath put in his awne power:
Acts.1.8	but ye shal receaue power after that the holy goost is come vpon you. And ye shalbe witnesses vnto me not onely in Ierusalem, but also in all Iewry and in Samary, and euen vnto the worldes ende.
Acts.1.9	And when he had spoken these thynges, whyle they beheld, he was taken vp an hye, Ꟶ a cloude receaued him vp out of their sight.
Acts.1.10	And while they looked stedfastly vp towarde heauen, as he went, beholde, two men stode by them in whyte apparell,
Acts.1.11	which also sayd: ye men of Galile, why stande ye gasynge vp into heauen? This same Iesus which is taken vp from you into heauen, shall so come, euen as ye haue sene him go into heauen.
Acts.1.12	Then returned they vnto Ierusalem from the mount (that is called Olyuete) which is from Ierusalem, a Saboth dayes iorney.
Acts.1.13	And when they were come in, they went vp into a parler, where aboade both Peter and Iames, and Iohn and Andrew, Philip Ꟶ Thomas, Barthelemew and Mathew, Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Simon zelotes, and Iudas the brother of Iames.
Acts.1.14	These all contynued with one accorde in prayer and supplicacyon with the wemen Ꟶ Mary the mother of Iesu, and with hys brethren.
Acts.1.15	And in those dayes Peter stode vp in the myddes of the discyples, and sayde (the nombre of names that were together, were aboute an hundred and twentye.)
Acts.1.16	Ye men Ꟶ brethren, thys scripture must haue nedes ben fulfylled, which the holy goost thorowe the mouth of Dauid spake before of Iudas, which was gyde to them that toke Iesus.
Acts.1.17	For he was noumbred with vs, and had obtayned felowshypp in thys mynystracyon.
Acts.1.18	And the same hath now possessed a plat of grounde with the rewarde of iniquite: and when he was hanged, he burst a sondre in the myddes, and all his bowels gusshed out.
Acts.1.19	And it is knowen vnto all the inhabiters of Ierusalem: in so moch that the same felde is called in their mother tonge, Acheldama, that is to saye, the bloude felde.
Acts.1.20	For it is wrytten in the boke of Psalmes: hys habitacyon be voyde, and no man be dwellynge therin: and his Bysshoprycke let another take.
Acts.1.21	Wherfore of these men which haue companyed with vs (all the tyme that the Lorde Iesus had all hys conuersacyon amonge vs,
Acts.1.22	begynnynge at the baptyme of Iohn, vnto that same daye that he was taken vp from vs) must one be ordeyned, to be a witnes with vs of hys resurreccyon.
Acts.1.23	And they apoynted two, Ioseph which is called Barsabas (whose syr name was Iustus) and Mathias,
Acts.1.24	And whan they prayed they sayde: thou Lorde, which knowest the hertes of all men, shewe whether of these two thou hast chosen:
Acts.1.25	that he maye take the roume of thys ministracyon and Apostleshypp, from which Iudas by transgressyon fell, that he myght go to hys awne place.
Acts.1.26	And they gaue forth their lottes, and the lot fel on Mathias, and he was counted with the eleuen Apostles.
Acts.2.1	When the fyftye dayes were come to an ende, they were all with one accorde together in one place.
Acts.2.2	And sodenly ther came a sounde from heauen, as it had bene the commynge of a myghty wynde, and it fylled all the house where they sate.
Acts.2.3	And there appered vnto them clouen tonges, lyke as they had bene of fyer, and it sate vpon eache one of them:
Acts.2.4	and they were all fylled with the holy goost, and beganne to speake with other tonges, euen as the same sprete gaue them vtteraunce.
Acts.2.5	Ther were dwellyng at Ierusalem, Iewes, deuoute men, out of euery nacyon of them that are vnder heauen.
Acts.2.6	When thys was noysed aboute, the multitude came together, Ꟶ were astonnyed, because that euery man hearde them speake with his awne langage.
Acts.2.7	They wondred all, and marueyled, sayinge among them selues: beholde, are not all these which speake, of Galile?
Acts.2.8	And how heare we euery man his awne tong, wherin we were borne?
Acts.2.9	Parthians, and Medes and Elamytes, and the inhabiters of Mesopotamia, and of Iury, and of Capadocia, of Ponthus and Asia,
Acts.2.10	Phrygia, and Pamphilia, of Egypte, and of the partyes of Lybia which is besyd? Syren, and straungers of Rome, Iewes Ꟶ Proselites.
Acts.2.11	Grekes and Arabians: we haue herd them speake in oure awne tonges the greate worckes of God.
Acts.2.12	They were all amased, and wondred sayinge one to another: what meaneth this?
Acts.2.13	Other mocked, sayinge: these men are full of new wyne.
Acts.2.14	But Peter stepped forth with the eleuen, and lyft vp his voyce, and sayde vnto them: Ye men of Iewrye, and all ye that dwell at Ierusalem: be this knowen vnto you, Ꟶ with youre eares heare my wordes.
Acts.2.15	For these are not droncken, as ye suppose, seynge it is but the thyrde houre of the daye.
Acts.2.16	But this it that which was spoken by the Prophete Iohel:
Acts.2.17	And it shalbe in the last dayes, sayth God: of my sprete I wyll poore out vpon all flesshe. And youre sonnes Ꟶ youre daughters shall prophesy, and youre yonge men shall se vysyons, and youre olde men shall dreame dreames.
Acts.2.18	And on my seruauntes, Ꟶ on my hande maydens I wyll poore out of my sprete in those dayes, and they shall prophesye.
Acts.2.19	And I wyll shewe wonders in heauen aboue, and tokens in the erth beneth, bloud and fyre and the vapour of smoke.
Acts.2.20	The sunne shalbe turned into darcknes, Ꟶ the moone into bloude, before that great and notable daye of the Lorde come.
Acts.2.21	And it shall come to passe, that whosoeuer shall call on the name of the Lorde, shalbe saued.
Acts.2.22	Ye men of Israel, heare these wordes: Iesus of Nazareth a man aproued of God amonge you with myracles, wonders and sygnes, which God dyd by hym in the myddes of you (as ye youre selues knowe)
Acts.2.23	hym haue ye taken by the handes of vnryghtewes persones, after he was delyuered by the determinat counsell Ꟶ foreknowledge of God, Ꟶ haue crucifyed and slayne him:
Acts.2.24	whom God hath raysed vp, Ꟶ loosed the sorowes of deeth, because it was vnpossible, that he shulde be holden of it.
Acts.2.25	For Dauid speaketh of him. A fore hande I sawe God alwayes before me: for he is on my ryght hande, that I shulde not be moued.
Acts.2.26	Therfore dyd my hert reioyce, Ꟶ my tonge was glad. Moreouer also my flesshe shall rest in hope,
Acts.2.27	because thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell, nether wilt thou suffre thine holye to se corrupcion.
Acts.2.28	Thou hast shewed me the wayes of lyfe, thou shalt make me full of ioye with thy countenaunce.
Acts.2.29	Ye men and brethren, let me frely speake vnto you of the patriarke Dauid: For he is both deed and buryed, and hys sepulchre remayneth with vs vnto this daye.
Acts.2.30	Therfore, seinge he was a Prophet, and knewe that God had sworne with an othe to him, that Christ (as concerninge the flessh) shulde come of the frute of his loynes, and on hys seat,
Acts.2.31	he knowyng this before, spake of the resurreccyon of Chryst, that his soule shulde not be left in hell: nether hys flesshe shulde se corrupcyon.
Acts.2.32	This Iesus hath God raysed vp, wherof we all are witnesses.
Acts.2.33	Sence now that he by the ryght hande of God exalted is, and hath receaued of the father the promyse of the holy Goost, he hath sheed forth thys which ye now se and heare.
Acts.2.34	For Dauid is not ascendyd into heuen: but he sayeth: The Lord sayde to my Lorde: syt thou on my ryght hand,
Acts.2.35	vntyll I make thy fooes thy fote stole.
Acts.2.36	So therfore, let all the house of Israel knowe for a suerty, that God hath made that same Iesus (whom ye haue crucified) Lorde and Chryst.
Acts.2.37	When they hearde this, they were pricked in their hertes, and sayd vnto Peter, Ꟶ vnto the other Apostles: Ye men Ꟶ brethren what shall we do?
Acts.2.38	Peter sayde vnto them: repent of youre synnes, and be baptysed euery one of you in the name of Iesus Chryst for the remission of synnes, and ye shall receaue the gyfte of the holy goost.
Acts.2.39	For the promyse was made vnto you and to youre chyldren, and to all that are a farre of, euen as many as the Lorde oure God shall call.
Acts.2.40	And with many other wordes bare he witnes, and exhorted them, sayinge: Saue youre selues from this vntowarde generacion.
Acts.2.41	Then they that gladly receaued his preachinge, were baptised: and the same daye, ther were added vnto them aboute thre thousande soules.
Acts.2.42	And they continued in the Apostles doctrine and felowshyp, Ꟶ in breakynge of bread, and in prayers.
Acts.2.43	And feare came ouer euery soule. And many wondres Ꟶ signes were shewed by the Apostles.
Acts.2.44	And all that beleued, kept them selues together, Ꟶ had all thynges commen,
Acts.2.45	and solde their possessions and goodes, and parted them to all men, as euery man had nede.
Acts.2.46	And they continued dayly with one accorde in the temple, Ꟶ brake bread from house to house, Ꟶ dyd eate their meate together, wt gladnes Ꟶ singlenes of hert,
Acts.2.47	praysinge God, and had fauour with all the people. And the Lorde added to the congregacion dayly, soch as shulde be saued.
Acts.3.1	Peter and Iohn went vp together into the temple at the nynth houre of prayer.
Acts.3.2	And a certayne man that was halt from hys mothers wombe, was brought, whom they layde daylie at the gate of the temple (which is called bewtyfull) to aske almes of them that entred into the temple.
Acts.3.3	When he sawe Peter and Iohn, that they wolde into the temple, he desyred to receaue an almes.
Acts.3.4	And Peter fastened his eyes on him with Iohn, Ꟶ sayd: loke on vs.
Acts.3.5	And he gaue hede vnto them, trustynge, to receaue some thynge of them.
Acts.3.6	Then sayde Peter: Syluer and golde haue I none such as I haue, geue I the. In the name of Iesus Chryst of Nazareth, ryse vp and walke.
Acts.3.7	And he toke hym by the ryght hand, and lyfte hym vp. And immediatly hys fete and anclebones receaued strength.
Acts.3.8	And he sprange, stode, and walked, and entred with them into the temple, walkynge, and leapynge, and praysynge God.
Acts.3.9	And all the people sawe hym walke and prayse God.
Acts.3.10	And they knewe hym, that it was he, which sate and begged at the beutyfull gate of the temple. And they wondred and were sore astonyed at that which had happened vnto hym.
Acts.3.11	And as the halt which was healed, helde Peter and Iohn, all the people ranne amased vnto them in the porche that is called Salomons.
Acts.3.12	When Peter sawe that, he answered vnto the people. Ye men of Isral, why maruayle ye at this, or why loke ye so on vs, as though by oure awne power or strength we had made thys man go?
Acts.3.13	The God of Abraham, and of Isaac and of Iacob, the God of oure fathers hath glorified hys sonne Iesus, whom ye delyuered, and denyed in the presence of Pylate, when he had iudged hym to be loosed.
Acts.3.14	But ye denyed the holy and iust, and desyred a mortherar to be geuen you,
Acts.3.15	and kylled the Lorde of lyfe, whom God hath raysed from deeth, of the which we are witnesses.
Acts.3.16	And hys name thorowe the fayth of his name, hath made this man sound, whom ye se and knowe. And the fayth which is by hym, hath geuen to hym thys health in the presence of you all.
Acts.3.17	And now brethren, I wote that thorow ignoraunce ye dyd it, as dyd also youre rulers.
Acts.3.18	But God (which before had shewed, by the mouth of all hys Prophetes, howe that Chryst shuld suffre) hath thus wyse fulfylled.
Acts.3.19	Let it repente you therfore, and conuerte, that youre synnes maye be done awaye when the tyme of refresshynge commeth, which we shall haue of the presence of the Lorde,
Acts.3.20	and when God shal sende him, which before was preached vnto you, that is to with Iesus Christ,
Acts.3.21	which must receaue heauen vntyll the tyme that all thynges, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all hys holy Prophetes sence the worlde began, be restored agayne.
Acts.3.22	Moses trulye sayde vnto the fathers: a Prophet shall the Lorde youre God rayse vp vnto you, euen of youre brethren lyke vnto me: him shall ye heare, in all thynges whatsoeuer he shall saye vnto you.
Acts.3.23	For the tyme wyll come, that euery soule which wyll not heare that same Prophet, shalbe destroyed from amonge the people.
Acts.3.24	All the Prophetes also from Samuel and thence forth (as many as haue spoken) haue in lyke wyse tolde of these dayes.
Acts.3.25	Ye are the chyldren of the Prophetes, and of the couenaunt, which God made vnto oure fathers, sayinge to Abraham: Euen in thy seede shal all the kynredes of the earth be blessed.
Acts.3.26	Fyrst whan God had raysed vp hys sonne Iesus vnto you, he sent him to blesse you, that euery one of you shulde turne from his wyckednes.
Acts.4.1	As they spake vnto the people, the prestes and the rulars of the temple, and the Saduces, came vpon them,
Acts.4.2	takyng it greuously, that they taught the people, and preached in Iesus the resurreccyon from deeth.
Acts.4.3	And they layde handes on them, and put them in holde vntyll the nexte daye: for it was now euentyde.
Acts.4.4	Howbeit many of them which hearde the wordes beleued, and the nombre of the men was aboute fyue thousande.
Acts.4.5	And it chaunsed on the morow, that their rulars and elders and Scribes,
Acts.4.6	(and Annas the chefe Prest, and Cayphas, and Iohn, and Alexander, Ꟶ as many as were of the kynred of the hye Prestes) gathered together at Ierusalem.
Acts.4.7	And whan they had set them before them they asked by what power, or in what name haue ye done this?
Acts.4.8	Then Peter full of the holy goost sayde vnto them ye rulars of the people, and elders of Israel,
Acts.4.9	yf we this daye be examined of the good dede that we haue done to the sycke man by what meanes he is made whoale:
Acts.4.10	be it knowen vnto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Iesus Chryst of Nazareth, whom ye crucyfyed, whom God raysed agayne from deeth: euen by him doth this man stande here present before you whoale.
Acts.4.11	This is the stone which was cast asyde of you buylders, which is become the chefe of the corner.
Acts.4.12	Nether is there saluacyon in eny other. For amonge men vnder heauen there is geuen none other name, wherin we must be saued.
Acts.4.13	When they sawe the boldnes of Peter and Iohn, and vnderstode that they were vnlerned and laye men, they marueyled, and they knewe them, that they had bene with Iesu:
Acts.4.14	and beholdynge also the man (which was healed) standynge with them, they coulde not saye agaynst it:
Acts.4.15	but commaunded them to go asyde out of the counsell, and counceled amonge them selues,
Acts.4.16	sayinge: what shall we do to these men? For a manifest sygne is done by them, and is openly knowen to all them that dwell in Ierusalem, and we cannot denye it.
Acts.4.17	But that it be noysed no farther amonge the people, let vs threaten and charge them, that they speake hence forth to no man in thys name.
Acts.4.18	And they called them, and commaunded them, that in no wyse they shulde speake ner teach in the name of Iesu.
Acts.4.19	But Peter Ꟶ Iohn answered and sayde vnto them: whether it be ryght in the sight of God, to herken vnto you more then to God, iudge ye.
Acts.4.20	For we cannot but speake, that which we haue sene Ꟶ heard.
Acts.4.21	So threatened they them, and let them go, and founde nothynge howe to punysshe them, because of the people. For all men praysed God because of that which was done:
Acts.4.22	for the man was aboue fourty yeare olde, on whom thys myracle of healynge was shewed.
Acts.4.23	Assone as they were let go, they came to theyr felowes, and shewed all that the hye Prestes and elders had sayde.
Acts.4.24	And when they hearde that, they lyfte vp their voyces to God with one accorde, and sayde: Lorde, thou art God, which hast made heauen and erth, the see, Ꟶ all that in them is,
Acts.4.25	which by the mouth of thy seruaunt Dauid hast sayd: Why dyd the hethen rage, and the people ymagen vayne thynges?
Acts.4.26	The kynges of the erth stode vp, and the rulars came together, agaynst the Lorde and agaynst hys anoynted.
Acts.4.27	For of a trueth, agaynst thy holy chylde Iesus (whom thou hast anoynted) both Herode and also Poncius Pylate, which the Gentyls and the people of Israel, gathered them selues together
Acts.4.28	for to do whatsoeuer thy hande and thy counsell determyned before to be done.
Acts.4.29	And now Lorde, beholde their threatenynges, and graunte vnto thy seruauntes, that with all confydence they maye speake thy worde.
Acts.4.30	So that thou stretche forth thyne hande, that healynge and sygnes and wonders be done by the name of thy holy chylde Iesus.
Acts.4.31	And assone as they had prayed the place moued where they were assembled together and they were all fylled with the holy Goost, and they spake the worde of God boldely.
Acts.4.32	And the multitude of them that beleued, were of one hert, Ꟶ of one soule. Neyther sayde anye of them, that ought of the thynges which he possessed, was hys awne: but they had all thinges commen.
Acts.4.33	And with greate power gaue the Apostles wytnes of the resurrecyon of the Lord Iesu. And great grace was with them all.
Acts.4.34	Nether was ther eny among them, that lacked. For as many as were possessers of landes or houses, solde them, and brought the pryce of the thinges that were solde,
Acts.4.35	and layed it downe at the Apostles fete: And distribucion was made vnto euery man accordynge as he had nede.
Acts.4.36	And Ioses, which was also called of the Apostles, Barnabas (that is to saye, the sonne of consolacyon) beynge a Leuite, and of the countre of Cypers
Acts.4.37	whan he had lande, solde it, and layde the pryce downe at the Apostles fete.
Acts.5.1	A certayne man named Ananias with Saphyra his wyfe solde a possession,
Acts.5.2	and kepte awaye parte of the pryce (hys wyfe also beynge of counsell) and brought a certayne parte, and layde it downe at the Apostles fete.
Acts.5.3	But Peter sayde: Ananias, how is it, that Sathan hath fylled thyne hert, that thou shuldest lye vnto the holy goost, and kepe awaye parte of the pryce of the lande?
Acts.5.4	Pertayned it not vnto the onely? Ꟶ after it was solde, was it not in thyne awne power? Why hast thou conceaued this thinge in thyne herte? Thou hast not lyed vnto men, but vnto God.
Acts.5.5	When Ananias herde these wordes, he fell downe, and gaue vp the goost. And great feare came on all them that hearde these thinges.
Acts.5.6	And the yonge men rose vp, and put hym a parte, and caryed hym out, and buried hym.
Acts.5.7	And it fortuned, that (as it were aboute the space of thre houres after) his wyfe came in, ignoraunt of that which was done.
Acts.5.8	And Peter sayde vnto her: Tell me, Solde ye not the lande for so moch? And she sayd: yee, for so moch.
Acts.5.9	Then Peter sayde vnto her: why haue ye agreed together, to tempt the sprete of the Lorde? Beholde, the fete of them which haue buried thy husband, are at the dore, and shall cary the out.
Acts.5.10	Then fell she downe strayght waye at his fete, and yelded vp the goost. And the yonge men came in, and founde her deed, Ꟶ caryed her out, Ꟶ buryed her by her husbande.
Acts.5.11	And great feare came on all the congregacyon, and on as many as hearde it.
Acts.5.12	By the handes of the Apostles were many sygnes and wondres shewed among the people. And they were all together with one accorde in Salomons porche.
Acts.5.13	And of other durst no man ioyne him self to them: neuertheles the people magnified them.
Acts.5.14	The nombred of them that beleued in the Lorde both of men and wemen, grewe more Ꟶ moare:
Acts.5.15	in so moch that they brought the sycke into the stretes, and layde them on beddes and couches, that at the least waye the shadowe of Peter when he came by, myght shadowe some of them,
Acts.5.16	There came also a multitude out of the cyties rounde aboute, vnto Ierusalem, bryngynge sycke folkes, and them which were vexed with vnclene spretes. And they were healed euery one.
Acts.5.17	Then the chefe Preste rose vp, and all they that were with him (which is the secte of the Saduces) and were full of indignacion,
Acts.5.18	and layde handes on the Apostles, and put them in the commen preson.
Acts.5.19	But the angell of the Lorde by nyght opened the preson dores, and brought them forth, and sayde:
Acts.5.20	go, and stande, and speake in the temple to the people all the wordes of this lyfe.
Acts.5.21	When they hearde that, they entred into the temple early in the mornynge: and taught. But the chefe preste came and they that were with him, and called a counsell together, and all the elders of the chyldren of Israel, and sent men to the preson, to fet them.
Acts.5.22	When the mynysters came, and founde them not in the preson, they returned and tolde,
Acts.5.23	sayinge: the preson truly founde we shut with all diligence, and the kepers standynge without before the dores. But when we had opened, we founde no man with in.
Acts.5.24	When the chefe Prest and the ruler of the temple, and the hye Prestes hearde these thynges, they douted of them, wher vnto thys wolde growe.
Acts.5.25	Then came one and shewed them: beholde, the men that ye put in preson, stande in the temple, and teach the people:
Acts.5.26	Then went the ruler of the temple, with ministres, and brought them without vyolence. For they feared the people, lest they shulde haue bene stoned.
Acts.5.27	And when they had brought them, they set them before the counsell. And the chefe Preste asked them,
Acts.5.28	sayinge: dyd not we straytely commaunde you: that ye shuld not teach in this name? And behold, ye haue fylled Ierusalem with youre doctryne, and intende to brynge this mans bloud vpon vs.
Acts.5.29	Peter and the other Apostles answered, Ꟶ sayde: We ought more to obey God then men.
Acts.5.30	The God of oure fathers raysed vp Iesus, whom ye slewe, and hanged on tre.
Acts.5.31	Hym hath God lyft vp with his ryght hand, to be a ruler and a sauiour, for to geue repentaunce to Israel, and forgeuenes of synnes.
Acts.5.32	And we are recordes of these thinges which we saye, and so is also the holy goost, whom God hath geuen to them that obey him.
Acts.5.33	When they hearde that, they claue asunder, and sought meanes to slee them.
Acts.5.34	Then stode ther vp one in the counsell, a Pharysey, named Gamaliel, a doctoure of lawe (had in reputacyon among all the people) and commaunded the Apostles to go asyde a lytell space,
Acts.5.35	and sayd vnto them: ye men of Israel, take hede to youre selues, what ye entende to do, as touchynge these men.
Acts.5.36	For before these dayes rose vp one Thudas, boastynge hym selfe, to whom resorted a nombre of men, about a foure hondred, which was slayn: and they all which beleued hym. were scatred abrode, and brought to nough
Acts.5.37	After this man, was ther one Iudas of Galile in the dayes of the tribute, and drewe awaye moche people after hym. He also perisshed and all, euen (as many as harkened to him) were scatered abrode.
Acts.5.38	And now I saye vnto you: refraine your selues from these men, and lett them alone. For yf this councel or this worke be of men, it wyll come to naught.
Acts.5.39	But and yf it be of God, ye cannot destroye it, lest haply ye be founde to stryue agaynst God.
Acts.5.40	And to hym agreed the other: and whan they had called the apostles, they bet them, and commaunded that they shulde not speake in the name of Iesu, and let them go.
Acts.5.41	And they departed from the counsell, I reioysinge, that they were counted worthy, to suffre rebuke for his name.
Acts.5.42	And dayly in the temple and in euery house they ceased not, to teach and preach Iesus Christ.
Acts.6.1	In those dayes (whan the nomber of the discyples grewe) there arose a grudge amonge the Grekes against the Hebrues, because their weddowes were despysed in the dayly ministracyon.
Acts.6.2	Then the twelue called the multitude of the disciples together and sayde, it is not mete, that we shuld leaue the worde of God: and serue tables.
Acts.6.3	Wherfore brethren, loke ye out amonge you seuen men of honeste report, and full of the holy ghost and wisdom, to whom we maye committe this busynes.
Acts.6.4	But we wyll geue oure selues continually to prayer, and to the ministracyon of the worde.
Acts.6.5	And the sayinge pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Steuen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost, and Philip, and Procorus, and Nichanor, and Timon, and Permenas, and Nicolas a conuert of Antioche.
Acts.6.6	These they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they layde theyr handes on them.

Acts.6.14	for we heard him saye: this Iesus of Nazareth shal destroye this place, and shal chaunge the ordinaunces, which Moses gaue vs.
Acts.6.15	And all that sate in the counsell, loked stedfastly on him, and sawe his face as it had bene the face of an aungell.
Acts.7.1	Then sayd the chefe preste: is it euen so?
Acts.7.2	And he sayd: ye men, brethren and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared vnto our father Abraham, whan he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
Acts.7.3	and sayd vnto hym: Get the out of thy countre, and from thy kynred, and come into the land, which I shall shewe the.

Acts.7.6	God verely spake on thys wise that his seade shulde sogeourne in a straunge lande, Ꟶ that they shulde kepe them in bondage, and entreate them euell .iiij.C. yeares.

Acts.7.10	and delyuered hym out of al his aduersities, and gaue him fauour Ꟶ wysdome in the syght of Pharao kynge of Egypte. And he made hym gouernoure ouer Egypte, and ouer all hys housholde.

Acts.7.19	The same dealt suttely with oure kinred, and euyll intreated our fathers, and made them cast out their yonge chyldren, that they shulde not remayne alyue.
Acts.7.20	The same tyme was Moses borne, and was acceptable vnto God, and nourysshed vp in hys fathers house thre monethes.
Acts.7.21	When he was cast out, Pharoes daughter toke him vp, Ꟶ nourysshed hym vp for her awne sonne.
Acts.7.22	And Moses was learned in all maner wysdome of the Egypcians, and was mighty in dedes and in wordes.
Acts.7.23	And whan he was full fourty yere old, it came into his hert, to vyset hys brethren the chyldren of Israell.
Acts.7.24	And when he sawe one of them suffre wrong, he defended him, Ꟶ auenged hys quarell that had the harme done to him, and smote the Egypcian.
Acts.7.25	For he supposed hys brethren wolde haue vnderstande, how that God by hys hande shulde delyuer them. But they vnderstode not.
Acts.7.26	And the next daye he shewed him self vnto them as they stroue, and wolde haue sett them at one agayne, sayinge: Syrs, ye are brethren, why hurte ye one another?
Acts.7.27	But he that dyd hys neyghboure wronge, thrust hym awaye, sayinge: who made the a ruler and a iudge ouer vs?
Acts.7.28	wilt thou kyll me, as thou dydest the Egypcian yesterdaye?

Acts.7.32	I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. Moses trembled, and durst not beholde.
Acts.7.33	Then sayd the Lorde to him: Put of thy shoes from thy fete, for the place where thou standest, is holy grounde.
Acts.7.34	I haue perfectlye sene the affliccyon of my people, which is in Egypte, and I haue heard theyr gronyng, and am come downe to delyuer them. And nowe come, and I wyll sende the into Egypte.

Acts.7.39	to whom our fathers wold not obey, but cast it from them, and in theyr hertes turned backe agayne into Egypt,
Acts.7.40	sayinge vnto Aaron: make vs goddes to go before vs. For as for thys Moses that brought vs out of the lande of Egypte, we wote not what is become of hym.
Acts.7.41	And they made a calfe in those dayes, and offered sacrifyce vnto the ymage, and reioysed ouer the workes of theyr awne handes.
Acts.7.42	Then God turned hym selfe, and gaue them vp, that they shulde worshyp the hoost of the skye, as it is written in the booke of the prophetes. O ye of the house of Israel, gaue ye to me sacrifyces and meate offerynges by the space of fourty yeares in the wyldernes?
Acts.7.43	And ye toke vnto you the tabernacle of Moloch, and the starre of youre God Rempham, fygures which ye made to worshyp them. And I will translate you beyonde Babylon.
Acts.7.44	Oure fathers had the tabernacle of witnes in the wyldernesse, as he had appoynted them speakyng vnto Moses: that he shulde make it, according to the fassyon that he had sene.
Acts.7.45	Which tabernacle also oure fathers that cam after, brought in with Iosue into the possession of the Gentyls, whom God draue out before the face of oure fathers, vnto the tyme of Dauid:
Acts.7.46	which founde fauoure before God, and wold fayne haue founde a tabernacle for the God of Iacob.
Acts.7.47	But Salomon bylt him an house.
Acts.7.48	Howbeit he that is hyest of al, dwelleth not in temples made with handes, as sayth the prophete:
Acts.7.49	heauen is my seate, and earth is my fote stole. What house wyll ye bylde for me, sayth the Lorde? or which is the place of my rest:
Acts.7.50	hath not my hand made al these thinges?
Acts.7.51	Ye stiffenecked and of vncircumcised hertes and eares: ye haue allwayes resysted the holy ghost: as youre fathers dyd, so do ye.
Acts.7.52	Which of the prophetes haue not your fathers persecuted? And they haue slaine them which shewed before of the comming of that Iust, whom ye haue nowe betrayd, and murdred.
Acts.7.53	And ye also haue receaued the lawe by the minystracyon of aungels, and haue not kept it.
Acts.7.54	When they heard these thinges, theyr hertes claue asunder, and they gnasshed on him with theyr teth.
Acts.7.55	But he beyng ful of the holy ghost, loked vp stedfastlye wt hys eyes into heauen, and sawe the glorye of God, and Iesus standyng on the ryght hande of God,
Acts.7.56	and sayd: beholde, I se the heauens open, and the sonne of man standyng on the right hand of God.
Acts.7.57	Then they gaue a shout with a loud voyce, and stopped theyr eares, and ranne vpon him all at once,
Acts.7.58	and cast hym out of the cytie, and stoned him. And the witnes layd downe theyr clothes at a yong mannes fete, whose name was Saul.

Acts.8.2	But deuout men dressed Steuen, and made great lamentacyon ouer hym.
Acts.8.3	As for Saul he made hauocke of the congregacyon, and entred into euery house, and drew out both men and women, and thrust them into preson.
Acts.8.4	Therfore, they that were scatered abrode, went euery where preachyng the worde of God.
Acts.8.5	Then came Philip into a cytie of Samaria, Ꟶ preached Christ vnto them.
Acts.8.6	And the people gaue hede vnto those thynges which Philip spake wt one accord, hearyng Ꟶ seyng the myracles whych he dyd.
Acts.8.7	For vncleane spretes cryinge with loude voyce, came out of many that were possessed of them. And many taken wt palsyes, Ꟶ many that halted, were healed.
Acts.8.8	And ther was great ioye in that cyte.

Acts.8.10	Whom they regarded, from the lest to the greatest, sayinge: this man is the power of God, which is called greate.
Acts.8.11	And him they sett moche by, because that of longe tyme he had bewitched them with sorceries.
Acts.8.12	But assone as they gaue credence to Philippes preachyng of the kyngdome of God, Ꟶ of the name of Iesu Christ, they were baptysed both men Ꟶ wemen.
Acts.8.13	Then Simon hym selfe beleued also. And whan he was baptised, he continued wt Philip, and wondred, beholding the miracles Ꟶ sygnes, which were shewed.

Acts.8.15	Which whan they were come downe, prayed for them, that they might receaue the holy ghost.
Acts.8.16	For as yet he was come on no one of them: but they were baptysed onely in the name of Christ Iesu.
Acts.8.17	Then layd they their handes on them, Ꟶ they receaued the holy ghos
Acts.8.18	When Simon sawe that thorow laying on of the apostles handes, the holy ghost was geuen, he offered them money,
Acts.8.19	saying: geue me also this power, that on whomsoeuer I put the handes, he maye receaue the holy ghost.
Acts.8.20	But Peter sayd vnto him: thy money perisshe with the, because thou hast thought that the gift of God maye be obteyned with money.
Acts.8.21	Thou hast nether parte, nor felowshyp in thys busynes. For thy hert is not ryght in the syght of God.
Acts.8.22	Repente therfore of thys thy wyckednes, Ꟶ praye God, that the thought of thyne herte maye be forgeuen the.
Acts.8.23	For I perceaue that thou art full of bitter gall, and wrapped in iniquite.
Acts.8.24	Then answered Simon Ꟶ sayde: praye ye to the Lorde for me, that none of these thynges which ye haue spoken, fall on me.
Acts.8.25	And they when they had testifyed and preached the worde of God, returned towarde Ierusalem, and preached the gospell in many cyties of the Samaritans.
Acts.8.26	The aungell of the Lorde spake vnto Philip, saying: aryse, Ꟶ go toward the south vnto the waye that goeth downe from Ierusalem vnto the cyte of Gaza, which is in the desert.

Acts.8.28	And as he returned home agayne syttinge in hys charet, he red Esay the prophete.
Acts.8.29	Then the sprete sayd vnto Philip: go neare, and ioyne thy self to yonder charet.
Acts.8.30	And Philip ran to hym, and heard him reade the prophete Esay, and sayd: Understandest thou what thou readest?
Acts.8.31	And he said: How can I, except I had a gyde? And he desyred Philip, that he wolde come vp, and sytt with hym.
Acts.8.32	The tenoure of the scripture which he read, was this: He was led as a shepe to be slayne: and lyke a lambe domme before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth.
Acts.8.33	Because of hys humblenes, he was not estemed. But who shal declare hys generacion? for his lyfe is taken from the earth.
Acts.8.34	The chamberlayn answered Philip, and sayd: I praye the of whom speaketh the prophete thys? of hym selfe, or of some other man?
Acts.8.35	Philip opened hys mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached vnto hym Iesus.
Acts.8.36	And as they went on theyr waye, they cam vnto a certen water, and the chamberlayne said: Se, here is water what doth let me to be baptysed?

Acts.9.15	The Lorde vnto him: go thy waye, for he is a chosen vessel vnto me, to beare my name before the Gentyls, and kynges, and the chyldren of Israel.
Acts.9.16	For I wyll shewe hym, how greate thinges he must suffre for my names sake.
Acts.9.17	And Ananias went his waye, and entred into the house, and put hys handes on hym, and sayd: brother Saul, the Lord that apperyd vnto the in the waye as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou myghtest receaue thy syght, and be fylled with the holy ghost.

Acts.15.24	For as moche as we haue hearde, that certayne which departed from vs, haue troubled you with wordes, and combred youre myndes saying: Ye must be circumcysed, and kepe the lawe, to whom we gaue no soch commaundement.
Acts.15.25	It semed therfore to vs a good thynge, when we were come together with one accorde, to sende chosen men vnto you, with oure beloued Barnabas and Paul,
Acts.15.26	men that haue ieoparded their lyues for the name of oure Lorde Iesus Christ.
Acts.15.27	We haue sent therfore Iudas and Sylas, which shall also tell you the same thinges by mouth.
Acts.15.28	For it semed good to the holy ghost and to vs, to charge you with no more then these necessary thynges:
Acts.15.29	that is to saye, that ye abstayne from thynges offered to ymages, and from bloud, and from straungled and from fornicacyon. From which yf ye kepe youre selues, ye shall do well. So fare ye well.
Acts.15.30	When they therfore were departed, they cam to Antioche and gathered the multytude together, Ꟶ deliuered the pistle.
Acts.15.31	Which when they had red, they reioysed of the consolacyon.
Acts.15.32	And Iudas Ꟶ Sylas being Prophetes, exhorted the brethren with moch preachynge, Ꟶ strengthed them.
Acts.15.33	And after they had taryed there a space, they were let go in peace of the brethren vnto the Apostles.
Acts.15.34	Not withstandyng it pleased Sylas, to abyde there styll
Acts.15.35	Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioche, teachynge Ꟶ preachynge the worde of the Lorde with other many.
Acts.15.36	But after a certayne space, Paul sayd vnto Barnabas: Let vs go agayne, and visite oure brethren in euery cytie where we haue shewed the word of the Lord, Ꟶ se how they do.
Acts.15.37	And Barnabas gaue counsell to take with them Iohn, whose syrname was Marcke.
Acts.15.38	But Paul wold not take him vnto their company which departed from them at Pamphilia, Ꟶ went not with them to the worcke.
Acts.15.39	And the contencion was so sharpe betwene them: that they departed asunder one from the other Ꟶ so Barnabas toke Marcke, and sayled vnto Cypers.
Acts.15.40	And Paul chose Sylas, Ꟶ departed, beynge commytted of the brethren vnto the grace of God.
Acts.15.41	And he went thorow Cyria and Cylicia, stablisshinge the congregacions:
Acts.16.1	Then cam he to Derba and to Lystra, And beholde, a certayne dyscyple was there named Timotheus a womans sonne, which was a Iewesse and beleued: but hys father was a Greke.
Acts.16.2	Of whom reported well the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium
Acts.16.3	Hym wold Paul that he shulde go forth with him, Ꟶ toke and circumcised hym, because of the Iewes which were in those quarters: for they knewe all, that hys father was a Greke.
Acts.16.4	As they went thorowe the cyties, they deliuered them the decrees for to kepe, that were ordeyned of the Apostles and elders, which were at Ierusalem.
Acts.16.5	And so were the congregacyons stablyshed in the fayth, and encreased in nombre dayly.
Acts.16.6	When they had gone thorow out Phrigia. and the region of Galacia, and were forbydden of the holy ghost to preach the word in Asia,
Acts.16.7	they came to Mysya, and sought to go into Bethynia. But the sprete soffred them no
Acts.16.8	But whan they had gone thorow Mysia they came downe to Troada.
Acts.16.9	And a visyon appered to Paul in the nyght. There stode a man of Macedonia and prayed him, saying: come into Macedonia, and helpe vs.
Acts.16.10	After he had sene the vision, immediatly we prepared to go into Macedonia, beinge certifyed that the Lorde had called vs, for to preach the gospell vnto them.
Acts.16.11	Whan we losed forth then from Troada, we came wt a strayte course to Samothracia, and the nexte daye to Neapolin,
Acts.16.12	Ꟶ from thence to Philippos, which is the chefe cytie in the partes of Macedonia, Ꟶ a fre cytie. We were in that cytie abydinge certayne dayes.
Acts.16.13	And on the Saboth dayes we went out of the citie besydes a ryuer, where men were wont to praye. And we sate downe, Ꟶ spake vnto the wemen which resorted thyther.
Acts.16.14	And a certayne woman (named Lydia) a seller of purple, of the cytie of Thyatira, which worshypped God, gaue vs audience. Whose hert the Lorde opened, that she attended vnto the thynges, which Paul spake.
Acts.16.15	When she was baptised, and her housholde, she besought vs, sayinge: If ye thyncke that I beleue on the Lorde, come into my house, and abyde there. And she constrayned vs.
Acts.16.16	And it fortuned as we went to prayer, a certayn damsell possessed with a sprete that prophesyed, met vs, which brought her master: Ꟶ mastres moche vauntage wt Prophesyinge.
Acts.16.17	The same folowed Paul and vs, and cryed, sayinge: these men are the seruauntes of the most hye God, which shew vnto vs the waye of saluacyon.
Acts.16.18	And thys dyd she many dayes. But Paul not content, turned aboute, and sayde to the sprete. I commaunde the in the name of Iesu Christ, that thou come out of her. And he came out the same houre
Acts.16.19	And when her master and mastres sawe that the hope of their gaynes was gone, they caught Paul and Sylas, and drue them into the market place vnto the rulars,
Acts.16.20	Ꟶ brought them to the officers, sayinge: These men trouble oure cytie seing they are Iewes,
Acts.16.21	Ꟶ preach ordinaunces, which are not laufull for vs to receaue, nether to obserue, seynge we are Romanys.
Acts.16.22	And the people ranne agaynst them, and the officers rent their clothes, Ꟶ commaunded them to be beaten with roddes.
Acts.16.23	And when they had beaten them sore, they cast them into preson, commaundynge the iayler of the preson to kepe them diligently.
Acts.16.24	Which when he had receaued such commaundement, thrust them into the ynner preson, Ꟶ made theyr fete fast in the stockes.
Acts.16.25	At mydnyght Paul Ꟶ Sylas prayed, and lauded God. And the presoners hearde them.
Acts.16.26	And sodenly ther was a greate erthquake, so that the foundacion of the preson was shaken, and immediatly all the dores opened and euery mannes bandes were loosed.
Acts.16.27	When the keper of the preson waked out of his slepe and sawe the preson dores open, he drue out his swearde and wolde haue kylled him selfe supposyng that the presoners had bene fledd.
Acts.16.28	But Paul cryed with a loude voyce, saying: do thy selfe no harme, for we are all heare.
Acts.16.29	Then he called for a lyght and sprange in and ran tremblynge vnto Paul, and fell downe at the fete of Paul Ꟶ Sylas,
Acts.16.30	and brought them out, Ꟶ sayde: Syrs what must I do to be saued?
Acts.16.31	And they sayde: beleue on the Lorde Iesus, Ꟶ thou shalt be saued Ꟶ thy housholde.
Acts.16.32	And they preached vnto him the worde of the Lord, Ꟶ to all that were in hys house.
Acts.16.33	And he toke them the same houre of the nyght, Ꟶ wasshed their woundes, and was baptised and all they of hys housholde strayght waye.
Acts.16.34	And when he had brought them into hys house, he set meate before them, and ioyed that he with all his housholde, beleued on God.
Acts.16.35	And when it was daye, the officers sent the ministers, saying: let those men go.
Acts.16.36	The keper of the preson tolde this sayinge to Paul: the officers haue sent word to lose you. Now therfore, get you hence and go in peace.
Acts.16.37	Then sayde Paul vnto them: they haue beaten vs openly vncondemned, for all that we are Romayns, and haue cast vs into preson: Ꟶ now wolde they sende vs awaye preuely? Naye Uerely, but let them come them selues, Ꟶ fet vs out.
Acts.16.38	When the ministers tolde these wordes vnto the officers, they feared when they hearde, that they were Romaynes
Acts.16.39	they cam and besought them: and brought them out, and desyred them, to departe out of the cytie.
Acts.16.40	And they went out of the preson, and entred into the house of Lidia, and when they had sene the brethren, they conforted them, and departed
Acts.17.1	As they made their iourney thorowe Amphipolis: and Appolonia, they cam to Thessalonica, where was a Synagoge of the Iewes.
Acts.17.2	And Paul (as hys maner was) went in vnto them, and thre Saboth dayes declared out of the scrypture vnto them, openynge
Acts.17.3	Ꟶ allegyng, that Christ must nedes haue suffred, and ryse agayne from deeth, and that thys Iesus was Christ, whom (sayde he) I preach to you.
Acts.17.4	And some of them beleued, and cam and companyed with Paul Ꟶ Sylas, and of the deuote. Grekes a greate multitude, and of the chefe wemen, not a feawe.
Acts.17.5	But the Iewes which beleued not, had indignacion and toke vnto them euyll men, which were vagabundes, and gathered a company, and set all the cytie on a roare, Ꟶ made assaute vnto the house of Iason, Ꟶ sought to brynge them out to the people.
Acts.17.6	And when they founde them not they drue Iason, Ꟶ certayne brethren vnto the heades of the cytie, cryinge: these that trouble the worlde, are come hyther also,
Acts.17.7	whom Iason hath receaued preuely. And these all do contrary to the decrees of Cesar, affirmynge another kynge, one Iesus.
Acts.17.8	And they troubled the people, Ꟶ the officers of the cytie, when they hearde these thinges.
Acts.17.9	And when they were sufficiently answered of Iason, and of the other, they let them go.
Acts.17.10	And the brethren immediatly sent awaye Paul and Sylas by nyghte vnto Berrea. Which when they were come thyther, they entred into the Synagoge of the Iewes.
Acts.17.11	These were the noblest of byrth amonge them of Thessalonia, which receaued the word with all dilygence of mynde, and searched the scryptures dayly, whether those thynges were euen so.
Acts.17.12	And many of them beleued: also of worshypfull wemen which were Grekes, and of men not a feawe.
Acts.17.13	When the Iewes of Thessalonia had knowledge, that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berrea: they came, and moued the people there.
Acts.17.14	And then immediatly the brethren sent awaye Paul, to go as it were to the see: but Sylas and Timotheus abode there styll
Acts.17.15	And they that gyded Paul, brought him vnto Athens, Ꟶ receaued a commaundement vnto Sylas Ꟶ Timotheus, for to come to hym wt spede, Ꟶ came their waye.
Acts.17.16	Whil Paul wayted for them at Athens, his sprete was moued in him, whan he sawe the cytie geuen to worshippynge of ymages.
Acts.17.17	Then disputed he in the synagoge with the Iewes, and with the deuoute personnes: and in the market dayly with them that came vnto him by chaunce.
Acts.17.18	Certayne Philosophers of the Epicures and of the Stoyckes, disputed with hym. And some ther were which sayde: what will thys babler saye? Other sayde: he semeth to be a tydynges brynger of newe deuyls, because he preacheth vnto them Iesus Ꟶ the resurreccion.
Acts.17.19	And they toke him, Ꟶ brought him into Marce strete, saying: maye we not knowe what thys newe doctryne wherof thou speakest, is?
Acts.17.20	For thou bryngest straunge tydynges to oure eares. We wold knowe therfore, what these thinges meane.
Acts.17.21	For all the Athenians and straugers which were there, gaue them selues to nothing els, but ether to tell, or to heare some newe thynge.
Acts.17.22	Paul stode in the myddes of Marce strete, Ꟶ sayde: ye men of Athens, I perceaue that in all thinges ye are to supersticyous.
Acts.17.23	For as I passed by, and behelde the maner how ye worshyp youre goddes, I founde an aulter wherin was writen: vnto the vnknowen God. Whom ye then ignorantly worshyppe, hym shew I vnto you.
Acts.17.24	God that made the worlde and all that are in it (seing that he is Lorde of heauen and earth) dwelleth not in tempels made with handes,
Acts.17.25	nether is worshipped with mennes handes, as though he neded of eny thynge, seinge he hym selfe geueth lyfe and breth to all men euery where,
Acts.17.26	Ꟶ hath made of one bloude all nacions of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath assigned before, how longe tyme, Ꟶ also the endes of their inhabitacyon,
Acts.17.27	that they shuld seke God, yf they myght fele and fynde him, though he be not farre from euery one of vs.
Acts.17.28	For in hym we lyue, moue, and haue oure beinge, as certayne of youre awne Poetes sayde: For we are also his generacion,
Acts.17.29	For as moch then as we are the generacyon of God, we ought not to thinke that the Godhead is lyke vnto golde, syluer or stone, grauen by crafte and ymaginacyon of man.
Acts.17.30	And the tyme of this ignoraunce God regarded not. But now biddeth all men euery where repen
Acts.17.31	because he hath appoynted a daye, in the which he will iudge the world wt ryghte wesnes, by that man by whom he hath appoynted, Ꟶ hath offered fayth to all men, after that he had raysed him from deeth.
Acts.17.32	When they hearde of the resurreccion from deeth, some mocked, and other sayd: we wyll heare the agayne of thys matter.
Acts.17.33	So Paul departed from amonge them.
Acts.17.34	Howbeit certayne men claue vnto hym and beleued: amonge the which was Dyonysyus a senatour, and a woman named Damaris, and other with them.
Acts.18.1	After thys, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corynthum,
Acts.18.2	and founde a certayne Iewe named Aquila, borne in Ponthus, lately come from Italie with his wyfe Priscilla (because that the Emperour Claudius had commaunded all Iewes to departe from Rome) and he drew vnto them,
Acts.18.3	because he was of the same crafte, he abode with them, Ꟶ wrought: theyr crafte was to make tentes.
Acts.18.4	And he preached in the synagoge euery Sabboth daye and exhorted the Iewes and the gentyls.
Acts.18.5	When Silas, and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was constrayned by the sprete, to testyfye to the Iewes that Iesus was very Chryst.
Acts.18.6	And when they sayde contrary Ꟶ blasphemed he shoke hys rayment and sayde vnto them: youre bloude be vpon youre awne heedes: from hence forth wyll I go blamelesse vnto the gentyls.
Acts.18.7	And he departed thence, and entred into a certayne mannes house, named Iustus, a worshypper of God, whose house ioyned hard to the synagoge.
Acts.18.8	Howbeit, one Crispus the chefe ruler of the synagoge beleued on the Lorde with all his housholde, and many of the Corinthians whan they gaue audience, beleued, and were baptised.
Acts.18.9	Then spake the Lorde to Paul in the nyght by a visyon: be not afrayde, but speake, and holde not thy peace:
Acts.18.10	for I am with the, Ꟶ noman shall inuade the that shall hurte the. For I haue moch people in this cytie.
Acts.18.11	And he continued there a yeare and syxe monethes, and taught them the worde of God.
Acts.18.12	When Gallio was ruler of the countre of Acaia, the Iewes made insurreccyon with one accorde agaynst Paul, and brought hym to the iudgement seate,
Acts.18.13	sayinge: this felowe counceleth men to worship God contrary to the lawe.
Acts.18.14	And whan Paul nowe was about to open his mouth, Gallio sayd vnto the Iewes: yf it were a matter of wronge, or an euyll dede (O ye Iewes) reason wolde that I shulde heare you:
Acts.18.15	but yf it be a question of wordes or of names, or of youre lawe, loke ye to it youre selues, For I will be no iudge of soche matters,
Acts.18.16	and he draue them from the seate.
Acts.18.17	Then all the Grekes toke Softenes the chefe ruler of the Synagoge, and smote hym before the iudges seate, And Gallio cared for none of those thynges.
Acts.18.18	Paul after thys, taryed there yet a good whyle, and then toke his leaue of the brethren and sayled thence into Ciria, Priscilla and Aquila accompanyinge hym. And he shore his heed in Cenchrea, for he had a vowe:
Acts.18.19	And he cam to Ephesus and lefte them there: but he hym selfe entred into the Synagoge, and reasoned with the Iewes.
Acts.18.20	When they desyred him to tary longer tyme with them, he consented not,
Acts.18.21	but bad them fare well sayinge. I must nedes (at thys feast that cometh) be in Ierusalem: but I wyll returne agayne vnto you yf God will. And he departed from Ephesus:
Acts.18.22	and whan he was come vnto Cesarea: and ascended vp and saluted the congregacyon, he departed vnto Antioche:
Acts.18.23	and when he had taryed there a whyle, he departed: and went ouer all the countre of Galacia and Phrygia by order, strengthynge all the discyples.
Acts.18.24	And a certayne Iew named Apollos, borne at Alexandria, came to Ephesus, an eloquent man, and myghty in the scryptures
Acts.18.25	The same was informed in the waye of the Lorde, and spake feruently in the sprete, and taught diligently the thinges of the Lord, Ꟶ knewe but the baptyme of Iohn onely.
Acts.18.26	And the same began to speake boldely in the Synagoge. Whom when Priscilla Ꟶ Aquila had hearde they toke him vnto them, Ꟶ expounded vnto hym the waye of God more perfectly.
Acts.18.27	And when he was disposed to go into Acaia, the brethren wrote, exhortyng the discyples to receaue him. Which whan he was come helped them moche which had beleued thorow grace.
Acts.18.28	For he ouercame the Iewes myghtely, and that openly, shewynge by the scryptures, that Iesus was Chryst.
Acts.19.1	It fortuned that whyll Apollo was at Corinthum, Paul passed thorowe the vpper coastes, and came to Ephesus, and founde certayne dysciples,
Acts.19.2	and sayde vnto them haue ye receaued the holy ghost, sence ye beleued? And they sayde vnto hym: no, we haue not hearde whether ther be eny holy ghost or no.
Acts.19.3	And he sayde vnto them. wherwith were ye then baptysed? And they sayde: with Iohns baptyme.
Acts.19.4	Then sayde Paul: Iohn verely baptysed with the baptim of repentaunce, sayinge vnto the people that they shulde beleue on hym, which shuld come after him: that is on Christ Iesus.
Acts.19.5	When they hearde thys, they were baptysed in the name of the Lorde Iesu.
Acts.19.6	And whan Paul layde hys handes vpon them. the holy ghost came on them, and they spake with tonges, and prophesyed,
Acts.19.7	and all the men were aboute twelue.
Acts.19.8	And he went into the synagoge, and behaued hym selfe boldely for the space of thre monethes, disputinge and geuinge them exhortacions of the kyngdome of God.
Acts.19.9	When dyuers wexed hard herted and beleued not, but spake euyll of the waye (and that before the multitude) he departed from them, and seperated the disciples. And he disputed dayly in the scole of one called Tyranus.
Acts.19.10	And this contynued by the space of two yeares: so that all they which dwelt in Asia, heard the worde of the Lorde Iesu, both Iewes and Grekes.
Acts.19.11	And God wrought speciall myracles by the handes of Paul:
Acts.19.12	so that from his body, were brought vnto the sicke, napkins Ꟶ partelettes, Ꟶ the diseases departed from them, and the euyll spretes went out of them.
Acts.19.13	Then certayne of the vagabunde Iewes exorcistes, toke vpon them to call ouer them (which had euyll spretes) the name of the Lorde Iesus, sayinge: We adiure you by Iesu, whom Paul preacheth.
Acts.19.14	And ther were seuen sonnes of one Sceua a Iew and chefe of the prestes which dyd so.
Acts.19.15	And the euyll sprete answered and sayd: Iesus I knowe, Ꟶ Paul I knowe: but who are ye?
Acts.19.16	And the man in whom the euyll sprete was, ranne on them, and ouercame them, and preuayled agaynst them so that they fledd out of that house naked and wounded.
Acts.19.17	And this was knowen to all the Iewes and Grekes also, which dwelt at Ephesus, Ꟶ feare came on them all, Ꟶ the name of the Lorde Iesus was magnyfyed.
Acts.19.18	And many that beleued, cam, and confessed and shewed their worckes.
Acts.19.19	Many of them which vsed curious craftes, brought their bokes, and burned them before all men, and they counted the pryce of them, and founde it fyfty thousand syluerlynges.
Acts.19.20	So mightely grewe the word of God, and preuayled.
Acts.19.21	After these thynges were ended, Paul purposed in the sprete (whan he had passed ouer Macedonia and Achaia) to go to Ierusalem, saying: After I haue bene there, I must also se Rome.
Acts.19.22	So sent he into Macedonia two of them that ministred vnto hym, euen Timotheus Ꟶ Erastus: but he hym selfe remayned in Asia for a season.
Acts.19.23	The same tyme ther arose no lytell a do aboute that waye.
Acts.19.24	For a certayne man named Demetrius, a syluersmyth (which made syluer shrynes for Diana) was not a lytell beneficiall vnto the craftesmen.
Acts.19.25	Whom he called together with the workemen of lyke occupacion, and sayd: Syrs, ye knowe that by this crafte we haue aduauntage.
Acts.19.26	Moreouer, ye se Ꟶ heare that not alone at Ephesus, but allmost thorowe out all Asia, thys Paul hath persuaded Ꟶ turned awaye moche people sayinge, that they be not goddes which are made with handes.
Acts.19.27	So that not only this oure crafte cometh into parell to be set at nought: but also that the temple of the greate Goddesse Diana shulde be despysed, Ꟶ her magnificence shulde be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshyppeth.
Acts.19.28	When they hearde these sayinges, they were full of wrathe, Ꟶ cryed out, sayinge. Greate is Diana of the Ephesians.
Acts.19.29	And al the cytie was on a rore, and they russhed into the comen hall with one assent, Ꟶ caught Gaius and Aristarcus, men of Macedonia, Pauls companions.
Acts.19.30	When Paul wolde haue entred in vnto the people, the dysciples suffred hym not.
Acts.19.31	But certayne of the chefe of Asia (which were his frendes) sent vnto him, desyrynge him, that he wolde not preace into the comen hall.
Acts.19.32	Some therfore cryed one thyng and some another, Ꟶ the congregacion was all out of quiete, Ꟶ the moare parte knewe not wherfore they were come together.
Acts.19.33	Some of the company drue forth Alexander, the Iewes thrustynge hym forwardes. Alexander: beckened with the hande, and wolde haue geuen the people an answer.
Acts.19.34	When they knewe that he was a Iewe, ther arose a shoute almost for the space of two houres, of all men, cryinge: greate is Diana of the Ephesyans.
Acts.19.35	When the towne clarcke had ceased the people, he sayde: ye men of Ephesus, what man is it that knoweth not how that the cytie of the Ephesyans is a worshypper of the great goddesse Diana, of the ymage which cam from heauen.
Acts.19.36	Seinge then that no man sayth here agaynst, ye ought to be content, and to do nothynge rashly:
Acts.19.37	for ye haue brought hyther these men: which are nether robbers of churches, not yet despisers of youre goddesse
Acts.19.38	Wherfore, yf Demetrius and the craftes men which are with hym, haue a matter agaynst eny man, the lawe is open, and ther are rulers, let them accuse one another.
Acts.19.39	But yf ye goo aboute eny other thynge, it shall be determined in a lawfull congregacyon.
Acts.19.40	For we are in ieopardy to be accused of thys dayes vproure, for as moche as ther is no cause, wherby we maye geue a rekenynge of thys concourse of people.
Acts.19.41	And when he had thus spoken, he let the congregacion departe.
Acts.20.1	After that the rage was ceased, Paul called the dyscyples vnto hym, and toke hys leaue of them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.
Acts.20.2	And when he had gone ouer those partyes, and had geuen them a longe exhortacyon, he cam into Grece
Acts.20.3	Ꟶ there abode .iij. monethes. And when the Iewes layde wayt for him as he was about to sayle into Syria, he purposed to returne thorow Macedonia.
Acts.20.4	Ther accompanied him into Asia, Sopater of Berrea, and of Thessalonia, Aristarcus and Secundus, and Gayus of Derba, Ꟶ Timotheus, Ꟶ out of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.
Acts.20.5	These goynge before, taryed vs at Troas.
Acts.20.6	And we sayled awaye from Philippos after the dayes of swete bread, and cam vnto them to Troas in fyue dayes, where we abode seuen dayes.
Acts.20.7	And vpon one of the Saboth dayes, whan the disciples came together for to breake breed Paul preached vnto them (ready to departe on the morowe) Ꟶ continued the preaching vnto mydnyght.
Acts.20.8	And there were many lyghtes in the chamber, where we were gathered together,
Acts.20.9	Ꟶ ther sate in a wyndowe a certayne yonge man (named Euticus) beinge fallen into a depe sleepe. And as Paul was preachinge, he was the more ouercome with slepe, and fell downe from the thyrde lofte, Ꟶ was taken vp deed.
Acts.20.10	But whan Paul went doune, he fell on him Ꟶ embrased him and sayde: make nothynge a do, for his lyfe is in hym.

Acts.20.35	I haue shewed you all thinges, how that so laboring ye ought to receaue the weake, Ꟶ to remember the wordes of the Lorde Iesu, how that he sayd: it is more blessed to geue then to receaue.
Acts.20.36	And when he had thus spoken, he kneled downe and prayed with them all.
Acts.20.37	And they all wepte sore and fell on Pauls necke, and kyssed hym,
Acts.20.38	sorowynge, most of all for the wordes which he spake, that they shulde se hys face nomore. And they conuayed hym vnto the shyppe.

Acts.21.8	The nexte daye, we that were of Pauls company departed, and came vnto Cesarea. And we entred into the house of Philip the Euangelist, which was one of the seuen, Ꟶ abode wt hym.
Acts.21.9	The same man had fower daughters virgens, which dyd prophesy.
Acts.21.10	And as we taryed there a good mayny of dayes, there cam a certaine prophet from Iurie, named Agabus.

Acts.21.12	When we hearde this, both we and other which were of the same place, besought him that he wolde not go vp to Ierusalem.
Acts.21.13	Then Paul answered, Ꟶ sayde: what do ye wepynge Ꟶ veryng myne herte? I am ready, not to be bounde onely, but also to dye at Ierusalem for the name of the Lorde Iesu.

Acts.21.19	And when he had saluted them, he tolde by order all thynges, that God had wrought amonge the gentyls by his ministracyon.
Acts.21.20	And when they hearde it, they glorifyed the Lorde, and sayde vnto him: Thou seest brother, how many thousande Iewes ther are which beleue, and they are all ernest folowers ouer the lawe.
Acts.21.21	And they are informed of the, that thou teachest all the Iewes which are amonge the gentyls, to forsake Moses: and sayst, that they ought not to circuncise theyr chyldren, nether to lyue after the customes.

Acts.22.2	When they hearde, that he spake in the Hebrue tonge to them, they kept the more sylence. And he sayeth:
Acts.22.3	I am verely a man which am a Iewe borne in Tarsus a cytie in Cycile: neuertheles, yet brought vp in thys cytie, at the fete of Gamaliell, and informed dilygently in the lawe of the fathers, and was seruent mynded to God warde, as ye all are thys same daye,
Acts.22.4	and I persecuted thys waye vnto the death byndynge and delyueryng into preson both men and wemen,
Acts.22.5	as the chefe preste doth beare me wytnesse, and all the estate of the elders: of whom also I receaued lettres vnto the brethren, and went to Damasco to bring them, (which were there bounde) vnto Ierusalem for to be punysshed.
Acts.22.6	And it fortuned (that as I made my iorney and was come nye vnto Damasco aboute none) sodenly there shone from heauen a greate lyght ronnde aboute me,
Acts.22.7	and I fell vnto the earthe, and hearde a voyce sayinge vnto me: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
Acts.22.8	And I answered: what arte thou Lorde? And he sayde vnto me: I am Iesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
Acts.22.9	And they that were wyth me, sawe verely a lyghte, and were afrayde: but they hearde not the voyce of hym that spake with me.
Acts.22.10	And I sayde: what shall I do Lorde? And the Lorde sayde vnto me: Aryse, and go into Damasco, and there it shall be tolde the of all thynges, whych are appoynted for the to do.
Acts.22.11	And whan I sawe nothynge for the bryghtnes of that lyght, I was leade by the hande of them that were wyth me, and came into Damasco.
Acts.22.12	And one Ananias a parfecte man, (and as pertaynynge to the lawe hauynge good reporte of all the Iewes, whych there dwelt)
Acts.22.13	cam vnto me, and stode, and sayde vnto me: Brother Saul, receaue thy lyght. And the same houre I receaued my syghte, and sawe hym.
Acts.22.14	And he sayde: the God of our fathers hath ordeyned the before, that thou shuldest knowe hys wyll, and shuldest heare the voyce of hys mouth:
Acts.22.15	for thou shalt be hys wytnes vnto all men of those thinges, which thou hast sene and heard.
Acts.22.16	And nowe, why taryest thou? Aryse, and be baptysed, and wasshe awaye thy synnes in callyng on the name name of the Lorde.
Acts.22.17	And it fortuned, that whan I was come agayne to Ierusalem, and prayde in the temple, I was in a traunce,
Acts.22.18	and sawe hym, sayinge vnto me: Make haste, and get the quyckly oute of Ierusalem: for they wyll not receaue thy wytnesse, that thou bearest of me
Acts.22.19	And I sayde: Lorde, they knowe that I presoned, and bett in euery Synagoge them that beleued on the.
Acts.22.20	And whan the bloude of thy wytnes Steuen was shed, I also stode by, and consented vnto hys death, and kept the rayment of them that slewe hym.
Acts.22.21	And he sayd vnto me departe, for I wyll sende the a farre hence vnto the Gentyls.
Acts.22.22	They gaue hym audience vnto thys worde, and then lyft vp theyr voyces and sayde: awaye with soche a felowe from the earth: for it is not reason that he shuld lyue.
Acts.22.23	And as they cryed, and cast of thir clothes, and thrue dust into the ayer,
Acts.22.24	the captayne commaunded hym to be brought into the castle, and bad that he shulde be scourged, and to be examined, that he might knowe, wherfore they cryed so on hym.
Acts.22.25	And whan they bounde hym wyth thonges, Paul sayde vnto the Centurion, that stode by him: Is it lauful for you to scourge a man that is a Romayn and vncondempned?
Acts.22.26	When the Centurion hearde that, he went and tolde the vpper captayne, saying: What intendest thou to do? For thys man is of Rome.
Acts.22.27	Then the vpper captayne cam, and sayd vnto him: tell me, art thou a Romayne? He sayd: Yee.
Acts.22.28	And the captayne answered, with a great some obtayned I thys fredom. And Paul sayd: I was fre borne.
Acts.22.29	Then strayght waye departed from hym they which shulde haue examyned hym. And the hye captayne also was afrayde, after he knewe that he was a Romayne, and because he had bounde hym.
Acts.22.30	On the morowe (because he wolde haue knowen the certentye wherfore he was accused of the Iewes) he losed hym from hys bondes, and commaunded the hye prestes and all the counsell to come together and brought Paul forth, Ꟶ set hym before them.
Acts.23.1	Paul behelde the councel, and sayde: men, and brethren I haue lyued in all good conscyence before God vntyll this daye.
Acts.23.2	And the hye preste Ananias commaunded them that stode by, to smyte hym on the mouth.
Acts.23.3	Then sayde Paul vnto hym: God shall smyte the thou paynted wall. Syttest thou and iudgest me after the lawe: and commaundest me to be smytten contrary to the lawe?
Acts.23.4	And they that stode by, sayde reuylest thou Goddes hye preste?
Acts.23.5	Then sayd Paul: I wist not brethren, that he was the hye preste. For it is wrytten: thou shalt not curse the ruler of thy people.
Acts.23.6	When Paul perceaued that the one parte were Saduces, and the other Pharises, he cryed out in the councell: Men and brethren, I am a Pharisey, the sonne of a Pharisey. Of the hope and resurreccyon from death, I am iudged.
Acts.23.7	And whan he had so sayde, there arose a debate betwene the Phariseyes and the Saduces and the multitude was deuyded.
Acts.23.8	For the Saduces saye, that there is no resurreccyon, nether angel, nor sprete: But the Phariseyes graunt both.
Acts.23.9	And there arose a greate crye: and whan the Scrybes which were of the Phariseyes parte arose, they stroue saying: we fynde none euyll in thys man. Though a sprete or an angell hath apeared to hym, let vs not stryue agaynst God.
Acts.23.10	And when there arose greate debate, the captayne (fearyng, lest Paul shulde haue bene pluckte a sondre of them) commaunded the soudyers to go downe, and to take hym from amonge them, and to brynge hym into the castell.
Acts.23.11	The nyght folowynge, God stode by hym, and sayde: be of good cheare Paul: for as thou hast testifyed of me in Ierusalem so must thou beare wytnesse also at Rome.
Acts.23.12	And whan it was daye, certayne of the Iewes gathered them selues togeather, and made a vowe, sayinge: that they wolde nether eate nor dryncke, tyll they had kylled Paul.
Acts.23.13	They were moo then fourtye men, which had made thys conspiracyon.
Acts.23.14	And they came to the chefe prestes and elders, and sayde: we haue bounde oure selues with a vowe, that we wyll eate nothynge, vntyll we haue slayne Paul.
Acts.23.15	Nowe therfore geue ye knowledge to the vpper captayne and to the councell, that he brynge hym forth vnto vs to morowe, as though we wold knowe some thyng more perfectly of him. But we (or euer he come neare) are redy to kyll hym.
Acts.23.16	Whan Pauls systers sonne hearde of theyr layinge awayte, he went, and entred into the castell, and tolde Paul.
Acts.23.17	And Paul called one of the vnder captaynes vnto him and sayde: brynge thys younge man vnto the hye captayne: for he hath a certayne thynge to shewe hym.
Acts.23.18	And he toke hym and brought hym to the hye captayne, and sayd: Paul the presoner called me vnto hym, and prayed me to brynge thys younge man vnto the, whych hath a certayne matter to shewe the.
Acts.23.19	The hye captayne toke hym by the hand, and went with him out of the waye, and asked him: what is yt that thou hast to tell me?
Acts.23.20	And he sayde: the Iewes are determyned to desyre the, that thou woldest brynge forth Paul to morow into the counsell, as though they wolde enquyre somwhat of hym more perfectly.
Acts.23.21	But folowe not thou theyr myndes: for there lye in wayte for hym of them, moo then fourtye men, which haue bounde them selues with a vowe, that they will nether eate nor dryncke, tyll they haue kylled hym. And now are they redy, and loke that thou shuldest promes.
Acts.23.22	The vpper captayne then let the younge man departe, and charged hym, sayinge: se thou, tell it oute to no man, that thou hast shewed these thynges to me:
Acts.23.23	And he called vnto hym two vnder captaynes sayinge: make ready two hundred soudiers to go to Cesarea, and horssmen threscore, and ten: and speare men two hundred, at the thyrde houre of the nyghte.
Acts.23.24	And delyuer them beastes, that they maye sett Paul on, and brynge hym safe vnto Felix the hye debyte
Acts.23.25	and he wrote a letter after thys maner.
Acts.23.26	Claudius Lysias vnto the most myghty rular Felix, sendeth, gretynges.
Acts.23.27	Thys man was taken of the Iewes, and shuld haue bene kylled of them. Then came I with soudyers, and reskued hym, and perceaued that he was a Romayn.
Acts.23.28	And when I wold haue knowen the cause, wherfore they accused hym, I broughte hym forth into theyr councell.
Acts.23.29	There perceaued I that he was accused of questions of their lawe. But was not gyltye of eny thynge worthy of death or of bondes.
Acts.23.30	And when it was shewed me, how that Iewes layde wayte ther for him, I sent hym strayght waye to the, and gaue commaundement to hys accusars, that the thynges, which they haue agaynst hym, they shulde tell before the: fare well.
Acts.23.31	Then the soudyers (as it was commaunded them) toke Paul, and brought hym by night to Antipatras.
Acts.23.32	On the morow they left the horssmen to go with hym, and returned vnto the castle.
Acts.23.33	Whych when they came to Cesarea, (and delyuered the epistle to the debyte) presented Paul also before him.
Acts.23.34	When the debite had redde the lettre, he asked of what countre he was. And when he vnderstode that he was of Cilicia
Acts.23.35	I wyll heare the (sayde he) when thyne accusars are come also: and he commaunded hym to be kepte in Herodes iudgement hall.
Acts.24.1	After fyue dayes, Ananias the hye preste descended with the elders, and with a certayne oratour named Tartullus, which enformed the debite against Paul.
Acts.24.2	And when Paul was called forth, Tartullus beganne to accuse hym, saying: Seyinge that we lyue in greate quietnes by the meanes of the, and that many good thynges are done vnto thys nacion thorowe thy prouidence.
Acts.24.3	that alowe we euer and in all places moost noble Felix with all thankes.
Acts.24.4	Notwithstandynge, that I be not tedious vnto the, I praye the, that thou woldest heare vs of thy curtesy a feaw wordes:
Acts.24.5	For we haue founde this man a pestilent felowe, and a mouer of debate vnto all the Iewes in the whole world, and a maynteyner of the secte of the Nazarites
Acts.24.6	which hath also enforsed to pollute the temple. Whom we toke, and wolde haue iudged accordinge to our lawe:
Acts.24.7	but the hye captayne Lisias came vpon vs, and with great violence toke hym awaye oute of oure handes,
Acts.24.8	commaundynge hys accusars to come vnto the. Of whom thou mayest (yf thou wilt enquyre) knowe the certenty of all these thinges, wherof we accuse him:
Acts.24.9	The Iewes lykewyse affermed, sayinge, that these thinges were euen so.
Acts.24.10	Then Paul (after that the debite hym selfe had beckened vnto hym that he shulde speake) answered: With a moare quiet minde do I answere for my selfe,
Acts.24.11	for as moche as I vnderstande, that thou hast bene of many yeares a iudge vnto thys people, because that thou mayest knowe, that ther are yet, but twelue dayes sence I went vp to Ierusalem for to worshyppe,
Acts.24.12	and they nether founde me in the temple disputynge with eny man, ether raysinge vp the people, nether in the Synagoges, nor in the cytie.
Acts.24.13	Nether can they proue the thynges wherof they accuse me
Acts.24.14	But thys I confesse vnto the, that after the waye (which they call heresye) so worship I the God of my fathers, beleuynge all thinges which are wrytten in the lawe Ꟶ the prophetes,
Acts.24.15	and haue hope towardes God, that the same resurreccion of the deed (which they them selues loke for also) shalbe, both of iust and vniust.
Acts.24.16	And therfore study I to haue allwaye a cleare conscience toward God, and towarde men.
Acts.24.17	But after many yeares, I came and brought almes to my people and offerynges
Acts.24.18	in the which they founde me purifyed in the temple, nether with multitude, nor yet with vnquyetnesse. Howbeit there were certen Iewes out of Asia,
Acts.24.19	which ought to be here present before the, and accuse me, yf they had ought agaynst me:
Acts.24.20	or elles lett these same here saye, yf they haue found any euyll doynge in me, whyle I stande here in the councell:
Acts.24.21	except it be for this one voyce, that I cryed standynge among them. of the resurreccyon from death am I iudged of you thys daye.
Acts.24.22	When Felix heard these thinges, he deferde them, for he knew very well of that waye, and sayde: when Lysias the captayne is come downe. I will knowe the vtmost of your matter.
Acts.24.23	And he commaunded an vndercaptayne to kepe Paul, and to let hym haue rest, and that he shuld forbyd none of hys acquayntaunce to minister vnto him, or to come vnto hym.
Acts.24.24	And after a certayne dayes, whan Felix came with his wyfe Drusilla (which was a Iewesse) he called forth Paul, and hearde hym of the fayth, which is towarde Chris
Acts.24.25	And as he preached of ryghtewesnes temperaunce, and iudgement to come, Felix trembled, and answered: Go thy waye for thys tyme: whan I haue a conuenient season, I wyll sende for the.
Acts.24.26	He hoped also, that money shulde haue bene geuen hym of Paul, that he myght loose him: wherfore, he called hym the oftenner and comened with hym.
Acts.24.27	But after two yeare, Festus Porcius came into Felix rowme. And Felix wyllynge to shewe the Iewes a pleasure, lefte Paul in preson bounde.
Acts.25.1	When Festus had receaued the offyce, after thre dayes, he ascended from Cesarea vnto Ierusalem.
Acts.25.2	Then enformed him the hye prestes and the chefe of the Iewes, of Paul. And they besought hym,
Acts.25.3	and desyred fauour agaynst hym, that he wolde sende for hym to Ierusalem: and they layde awayte for hym in the waye, to kyll hym.
Acts.25.4	Festus answered, that Paul shulde be kept. at Cesarea, but that he hym selfe wold shorly departe thyther.
Acts.25.5	Let them therfore (sayde he) which among you are able, come downe with vs, and accuse hym, yf there be any fawte in the man.
Acts.25.6	When he had taryed there amonge them more then ten dayes, he wente downe vnto Cesarea and the nexte daye sat downe in the iudgement seate, and commaunded Paul to be brought.
Acts.25.7	Which when he was come, the Iewes which were come from Ierusalem, stode aboute hym, and layde many and greueous complayntes agaynst Paul, whych they coulde not proue,
Acts.25.8	as longe as he answered for hym self that he had nether agaynst the lawe of the Iewes, nether agaynst the temple, nor yet agaynst Cesar offended any thynge at all.
Acts.25.9	Festus wyllynge to do the Iewes a pleasure, answered Paul, and sayde: wylt thou go vp to Ierusalem, and there be iudged of these thynges before me?
Acts.25.10	Then sayde Paul: I stande at Cesares iudgement seate, where I ought to be iudged. To the Iewes haue I no harme done, as thou very well knowest.
Acts.25.11	If I haue hurte them, or commytted any thyng worthy of death, I refuse not to dye. If no one of these thynges are, where of they accuse me, no man maye delyuer me to them, I appeale vnto Cesar.
Acts.25.12	Then spake Festus with deliberacyon, and answered: Thou hast appealed vnto Cesar: vnto Cesar shalt thou go.
Acts.25.13	And after a certayne dayes, kinge Agripa and Bernice came vnto Cesarea to salute Festus.
Acts.25.14	And whan they had bene there a good ceason, Festus rehearsed Paules cause vnto the kynge, sayinge: there is a certayne man lefte in preson of Felix,
Acts.25.15	aboute whom whan I came to Ierusalem, the hye prestes and elders of the Iewes enfourmed me, and desyred to haue iudgement agaynst hym.
Acts.25.16	To whom I answered: It is not the maner of the Romaynes, for fauoure to delyuer any man, that he shulde perysshe, before that he which is accused, haue the accusars before hym, and haue lycence to answere for hym selfe, concernynge the cryme layde agaynst hym.
Acts.25.17	Therfore, whan they were come hyther, withoute any delaye, on the morowe I sate to geue iudgment, and commaunded the man to be brought forth.
Acts.25.18	Agaynst whom, whan the accusars stode vp, they brought noone accusacion of soch thynges as I supposed:
Acts.25.19	but had certen questious agaynst hym of theyr awne supersticion, and of one Iesus which was deed, whom Paul affyrmed to be alyue.
Acts.25.20	And because I douted of soche maner of questions, I asked hym, whether he wolde go to Ierusalem, and there be iudged of these matters.
Acts.25.21	But whan Paul had appealed to be kepte vnto the knowledge of Cesar, I commaunded hym to be kepte, tyll I myght sende hym to Cesar.
Acts.25.22	Agripa sayde vnto Festus: I wolde also heare the man my selfe. Tomorowe, (sayde he) thou shalt heare hym.
Acts.25.23	And on the morowe whan Agripa was come and Bernice, with greate pompe, and were entred into the councell house, with the captaynes and chefe men of the cytie, at Festus commaundement was Paul brought forth.
Acts.25.24	And Festus sayde: kyng Agripa, Ꟶ all ye men which are heare present with vs, ye se thys man, about whom all the multitude of the Iewes haue intreated me, both at Ierusalem and also here cryinge, that he ought not to lyue any lenger.
Acts.25.25	Yet founde I nothyng worthy of death, that he had committed. Neuertheles, seying that he hath appealed to Cesar, I haue determined to send hym.
Acts.25.26	Of whom I haue no certayne thyng to write vnto my lord. Wherfore, I haue brought hym vnto you, and specially vnto the: O kynge Agripa, that after examinacyon had, I myght haue sumwhat to wryte.
Acts.25.27	For me thincketh it vnreasonable, for to sende a presoner, and not to shewe the causes which are layde agaynst hym
Acts.26.1	Agrippa sayde vnto Paul: thou art permytted to speake for thy selfe. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for hym selfe.
Acts.26.2	I thinke my self happy king Agrippa, because I shall answere this daye before the, of all the thinges wherof, I am accused of the Iewes:
Acts.26.3	namely, because thou arte experte in all customes and questions, which are among the Iewes. Wherfore I beseche the, to heare me paciently.
Acts.26.4	My lyuynge that I haue lead of a chylde (which was at the fyrst among myne awne nacion at Ierusalem) knowe all the Iewes,
Acts.26.5	which knewe me from the begynnynge, yf they wolde testyfye. For after the moost straytest secte of our religion, I lyued a pharisey.
Acts.26.6	And now I stande and am iudged for the hope of the promes made of God vnto oure father:
Acts.26.7	vnto which promes our twelue tribes (instantly seruyng God daye Ꟶ night) hope to come. For which hopes sake, kynge Agrippa, I am accused of the Iewes.
Acts.26.8	Why shulde it be thought a thynge incredyble vnto you, that God shulde rayse agayne the deed?
Acts.26.9	I also verely thought in my selfe, that I ought to do many contrary thynges, cleane agaynst the name of Iesus of Nazareth:
Acts.26.10	which thynge I also dyd in Ierusalem. And many of the saynctes dyd I shut vp in preson, and had receaued auctorite of the hye Prestes. And when they were put to deeth. I gaue the sentence.
Acts.26.11	And I punisshed them ofte in euery synagoge, and compelled them to blaspheme: and was yet more mad vpon them, and persecuted them, euen vnto straunge cyties.
Acts.26.12	About which thinges as I went to Damasco wyth auctorite and licence of the hye Prestes,
Acts.26.13	euen at myddaye. (O kyng) I sawe in the waye a lyght from heauen aboue the bryghtnes of the sonne shyne rounde about me, and them whych iorneyed wyth me.
Acts.26.14	When we were all fallen to the erthe, I heard a voyce speakynge vnto me, Ꟶ saying in the Hebrue tonge: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is harde for the to kicke agaynst the prickes.
Acts.26.15	And I sayd: Who art thou Lorde? And he sayde: I am Iesus whom thou persecutest,
Acts.26.16	but ryse and stand vp on thy fete. For I haue appeared vnto the for thys purpose, to make the a minister and a witnes both of those thynges whych thou hast sene, Ꟶ of those thynges in the which I will appeare vnto the,
Acts.26.17	delyueringe the from the people, and from the gentyls, vnto whom now I sende the,
Acts.26.18	to open their eyes, that they maye be turned from darckness to light, and from the power of Satan vnto God, that they maye receaue forgeuenes of synnes, and inheritaunce amonge them whych are sanctified by fayth that is toward me.
Acts.26.19	Wherfore (O kynge Agryppa) I was not disobedient vnto the heauenly visyon:
Acts.26.20	but shewed fyrst vnto them of Damasco, and at Ierusalem, and thorow out all the coastes of Iewry, and then to the gentyls, that they shuld repent, and turne to God, and do soch workes as become them that repent.
Acts.26.21	For thys cause the Iewes caught me in the temple, and went about to kyll me.
Acts.26.22	Seyng therfore that I haue obtained helpe of God: I contynew vnto thys daye, wytnessinge bothe to small Ꟶ to great, saying none other thynges, then those whych the prophetes and Moses dyd saye shuld come:
Acts.26.23	that Christ shulde soffer, and that he shulde be the fyrst that shuld ryse from deth, and shuld shew lyght vnto the people, and to the gentyls.
Acts.26.24	As he thus spake for hym selfe: Festus sayde with a loude voyce: Paul, thou art besyde thy selfe. Moch learnynge doth make the madd.
Acts.26.25	And Paul sayde: I am not mad (most deare Festus) but speake forth the wordes of trueth and sobernes.
Acts.26.26	For the kynge knoweth of these thynges, before whom also I speake frely: nether thynke I that eny of these thynges are hydden from him. For thys thynge was not done in a corner.
Acts.26.27	Kynge Agrippa beleuest thou the Prophetes? I wote well that thou beleuest.
Acts.26.28	Agrippa sayde vnto Paul: Sumwhat thou bryngest me in mynde for to become Chrysten.
Acts.26.29	And Paul sayde? I wolde to God that not onely thou: but also all that heare me to daye were, not somwhat onely, but all together, soch as I am, except these bondes.
Acts.26.30	And when he had thus spoken, the kynge rose vp, and the debite, and Bernice, and they that sate with them,
Acts.26.31	And when they were gone aparte, they talked betwene them selues, sayinge. Thys man doeth nothyng worthy of deeth, or of bondes.
Acts.26.32	Then sayde Agrippa vnto Festus. Thys man myght haue bene let loose, yf he had not appealed vnto Cesar.
Acts.27.1	When it was concluded, that we shuld sayle into Italy they delyuered both Paul Ꟶ certayne other presoners, vnto one named Iulius, an vndercaptayne of Cesars soudiars.
Acts.27.2	And we entred into a shyp of Adramicium, and loosed from land, apoynted to sayle by the coastes of Asia, one Aristarcus out of Macedonia, of the contre of Thessalonia taryinge styll with vs.
Acts.27.3	And the nexte daye we came to Sidon. And Iulius courteously entreated Paul, and gaue him lyberte, to go vnto his frendes, Ꟶ to refresshe hym selfe.
Acts.27.4	And whan we had launched from thence, we sayled harde by Cypers, because the wyndes were contrarye.
Acts.27.5	And whan we had sayled ouer the see of Cylicia, Ꟶ Pamphilia, we cam to Myra whych is in Lycia.
Acts.27.6	And there the vndercaptayne founde a shyppe of Alexandria ready, that sayled into Italy, and he put vs therin.
Acts.27.7	And when we had sayled slowly many dayes, and scace were come ouer agaynst Guydon (because the wynde wyth stode vs) we sayled harde by the coaste of Candy, ouer agaynst Salmo,
Acts.27.8	and wyth moche worke sayled beyonde it, Ꟶ came vnto a place which is called the fayre hauens. Nye wher vnto was the cytie of Lasea
Acts.27.9	when moche tyme was spent, and whan sayling was now ieoperdous, because also that they had ouerlonge fasted, Paul put them in remembraunce,
Acts.27.10	and sayd vnto them: Syrs I perceaue, that thys viage wilbe wyth hurte and moche damage, not of the ladynge and shyp onely, but also of your lyues:
Acts.27.11	Neuerthelesse the vnder captayne beleued the gouerner Ꟶ the master of the shyp more then those thynges whych were spoken of Paul.
Acts.27.12	And because the hauen was not commodious to wynter in, many toke counsell to departe thence, yf by eny meanes they myght attayne to Phenices Ꟶ there to wynter, whych is an hauen of Candy, and lyeth toward the southwest and north west wynde.
Acts.27.13	When the south wynde blewe, they supposynge to obtayne their purpose, loosed vnto Asson, and sayled past all Candy.
Acts.27.14	But not long after, ther arose agaynst theyr purpose, a flawe of wynde out of the northeast.
Acts.27.15	And when the shyp was caught Ꟶ could not resyst the wynde, we let her go, and draue with the wether.
Acts.27.16	But we were caryed in to an yle whych is named Clauda, and had moche worke to come by a bote,
Acts.27.17	whych they toke vp, and vsed helpe, Ꟶ made fast the shyppe, fearinge, lest they shuld fall into the Syrtes. And so they let downe a vessell, and were caryed.
Acts.27.18	The nexte daye (when we were tossed wyth an exceadinge tempest) they lyghttened the shyp,
Acts.27.19	and the thyrde daye we cast out wyth oure awne handes the taklynge of the shippe.
Acts.27.20	When at the last, nether the sunne nor starres in many dayes appeared, and no small tempest laye vpon vs, all hope that we shuld escape, was then taken awaye.
Acts.27.21	But after longe abstynence, Paul stode forth in the myddes of them, Ꟶ sayde: Syrs, ye shulde haue harkened to me, and not haue loosed from Candy, nether to haue brought vnto vs thys harme Ꟶ losse.
Acts.27.22	And now I exhorte you to be of good chere. For ther shalbe no losse of eny mans lyfe amonge you, saue of the ship onely.
Acts.27.23	For ther stode by me thys nyght the angell of God, whose I am, and who I serue,
Acts.27.24	saying: feare not Paul thou must be brought before Cesar, And lo, God hath geuen the all them that sayle wyth the.
Acts.27.25	Wherfore syrs be of good chere: for I beleue God, that it shalbe euen as it was tolde me.
Acts.27.26	How be it we must be cast into a certayne ylonde:
Acts.27.27	But when the fourtenth nyght was come (as we were sayling in Adria about mydnyght) the shypmen demed, that ther appeared some countre vnto them:
Acts.27.28	and sounded, Ꟶ founde it .xx. feddoms. And when they had gone a lytell further, they sounded agayne, and founde .xv. feddoms.
Acts.27.29	Then fearynge lest they shuld haue fallen on some rocke, they cast .iiij. ancres out of the sterne, and wysshed for the daye.
Acts.27.30	As the shypmen were about to flee out of the shyp (whan they had let downe the bote into the see, vnder a couloure, as though they wolde haue cast ancres out of the forshippe)
Acts.27.31	Paul sayde vnto the vndercaptayne and to the soudyers: excepte these abyde in the shypye cannot be safe.
Acts.27.32	Then the soudyers cut of the rope of the bote, and let it fall awaye.
Acts.27.33	And whan the daye beganne to appeare, Paul besought them all to take meate, sayinge: thys is the fourtenth daye, that ye haue taryed and contynued fastynge, receauynge nothing at all.
Acts.27.34	Wherfore, I praye you to take meate: for this no dout is for youre helth: for ther shall not an heer fall from the heed of eny of you.
Acts.27.35	And when he had thus spoken, he toke breed and gaue thankes to God in presence of them all: and whan he had broken it, he beganne to eate.
Acts.27.36	Then were they all of good cheare, and they also toke meate.
Acts.27.37	We were all together in the shyp, two hundred threscore and syxtene soules.
Acts.27.38	And when they had eaten ynough, they lyghtened the shyp, and cast out the wheate in to the see.
Acts.27.39	When it was daye, they knew not the lande, but they spyed a certayne hauen with a bancke, into the whych they were mynded (if it were possyble) to thrust in the shyp.
Acts.27.40	And when they had taken vp the ancres, they committed them selues vnto the see, and lowsed the rudder bondes and hoysed vp the mayne sayle to the wynde, and drue to lande.
Acts.27.41	And whan they chaunced on a place, whych had the see on both the sydes, they thrust in the shyp. And the foreparte stucke fast and moued not, but the hynder parte brake wyth the violence of the waues.
Acts.27.42	The Soudyars councell was to kyll the presoners, lest eny of them, when he had swome out, shulde ronne awaye.
Acts.27.43	But the vndercaptayne wyllinge to saue Paul, kept them from theyr purpose, and commaunded that they whych coulde swymme, shulde cast them selues fyrst into the see, and scape to lande.
Acts.27.44	And the other he commaunded to go, some on bordes, and some on broken peces of the shyp. And so it came to passe, that they escaped all safe to lande.
Acts.28.1	And when they were scaped, then they knewe, that: the yle was called Milete.
Acts.28.2	And the straungers shewed vs no lytell kyndnes: for they kyndled a fyre, and receaued vs euery one, because of the present rayne, Ꟶ because of the colde.
Acts.28.3	And when Paul had gathered a bondell of styckes, and layde them on the fyre, ther came a vyper out of the heat, Ꟶ caught hym by the hande.
Acts.28.4	When the straungers sawe the beast hange on hys hande, they sayde amonge them selues: no doute thys man is a mortherer: Whom (though he haue escaped the see) yet vengeaunce suffreth not to lyue.
Acts.28.5	And he shouke of the vyper into the fyre, and felt no harme.
Acts.28.6	Howbeit they wayted when he shulde haue swolne, or fallen downe deed sodenly. But after they had loked a greate whyle, and sawe no harme come to hym, they chaunged theyr myndes, and sayde that he was a God.
Acts.28.7	In the same quarters were londes of the chefe man of the yle (whose name was Publius) whych receaued vs, Ꟶ lodged vs thre dayes courteously.
Acts.28.8	And it fortuned that the father of Publius laye sycke of a feuer, and of a bloudy flixe. To whom paul entred in and prayde, and layde hys handes on hym Ꟶ healeth him.
Acts.28.9	So, when this was done, other also whych had dyseases in the yle, cam and were healed:
Acts.28.10	whych also dyd vs great honoure. And when we departed, they laded vs wt soch thynges as were necessary.
Acts.28.11	After thre monethes we departed in a ship of Alexandry, whych had wyntred in the yle, whose badge was Castor Ꟶ Pollux.
Acts.28.12	And when we came to Cyracusa, we taryed there thre dayes.
Acts.28.13	And from thence we fet a compasse, and came to Regium. And after one daye the south wynde blewe, and we came the nexte daye to Putiolus:
Acts.28.14	where we founde brethren, and were desyred to tary wyth them seuen dayes, and so came we to Rome.
Acts.28.15	And from thence, when the brethren hearde of vs, they came to mete vs at Apiphorum, and at the thre tauernes. When Paul sawe them, he thancked God, and wexed bolde.
Acts.28.16	And when we came to Rome, the vndercaptayne delyuered the presoners to the chefe captayne of the host: but Paul was suffred to dwell by hym selfe wyth a soudyer that kept hym.
Acts.28.17	And after thre dayes, Paul called the chefe of the Iewes together. And when they were come, he sayde vnto them: Men and brethren, though, I haue committed nothing agaynst the people or lawes of the Elders yet was I delyuered presoner from Ierusalem into the handes of the Romayns.
Acts.28.18	Whych when they had examined me, wolde haue let me go, because ther was no cause of death in me.
Acts.28.19	But when the Iewes spake contrary, I was constrayned to appeale vnto cesar: not that I had ought to accuse my people of.
Acts.28.20	For thys cause then haue I called for you, euen to se you, and to speake wyth you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bounde wt this cheyne.
Acts.28.21	And they sayde vnto hym: we nether receaued lettres out of Iewry pertayninge vnto the nether eny of the brethren that came shewed or spake eny harme of the.
Acts.28.22	But we wyll heare of the what thou thynckest. For as concernyng thys secte, we knowe that euery where it is spoken agaynst.
Acts.28.23	And when they had appoynted him a daye, ther came many to hym into hys lodgyng. To whom he expounded and testifyed the kyngdom of God and preached vnto them of Iesus: both out of the lawe of Moses and out of the Prophetes, euen from morninge to nyght.
Acts.28.24	And some beleued the thynges whych were spoken, and some beleued not.
Acts.28.25	And when they agreed not amonge them selues, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one worde: well spake the holy ghost by Esay the prophet vnto oure fathers,
Acts.28.26	saying: Go vnto thys people, and saye: wyth youre eares shall ye heare, and shall not vnderstande: and wyth youre eyes shall ye se, Ꟶ not perceaue.
Acts.28.27	For the hert of thys people is wexed grosse, and wyth their eares haue they had no lust to heare, and their eyes haue they closed: lest they shulde se wyth their eyes, Ꟶ heare wyth their eares, and vnderstande with their hertes, and shuld be conuerted, and I shuld heale them.
Acts.28.28	Be it knowen therfore vnto you, that thys saluacyon of God is sent to the gentyls, and they shall heare it.
Acts.28.29	And when he had sayde these wordes, the Iewes departed from him and had greate despycions amonge them selues.
Acts.28.30	And Paul dwelt two yeares full in hys lodgynge, and receaued all that cam in vnto hym,
Acts.28.31	preachinge the kyngdome of God, and teachynge those thynges whych concerne the Lorde Iesus wyth all confydence, no man forbyddyng hym.
