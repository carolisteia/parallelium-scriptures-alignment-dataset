Lev.7.19	And the flesh that toucheth any vncleane thynge shall not be eaten, but burnt wyth fyre: and all that be cleane, shall eate the flesh.
Lev.7.20	But yf any soule eate of the flesh of the peaceoffrynge that pertayneth vnto the Lorde hauynge hys vnclennesse vpon hym: the same soule shall peryshe from amonge hys people.
Lev.7.21	Moreouer, the soule that doth touche any vnclene thynge, that is of the vnclennesse of man or of any vnclene beast or any abhomynacyon that is vnclene: and then eate of the flesh of the peaceoffrynge whych pertayneth vnto the Lorde, that soule shall perysh from hys people.
Lev.7.22	And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying:
Lev.7.23	speake vnto the chyldren of Israel and saye. Ye shall eate no maner fatt of oxen of shepe and of goates:
Lev.7.24	neuerthelater the fatt of the beaste that dyeth alone, and the fatt of that whych is torne wyth wylde beastes, shall be occupied in any maner of vse, but ye shall in no wise eate of it.
Lev.7.25	For whosoeuer eateth the fatt of the beaste of whych men vse to brynge an offrynge vnto the Lorde, that soule that eateth it, shall perysh from his people.
Lev.7.26	Moreouer, ye shall eate no maner of bloude, whether it be of foule or of beast.

Lev.7.32	And the ryght shoulder shall ye geue vnto the Preaste, for an heueoffrynge, of youre peaceoffrynges.
Lev.7.33	The same that offreth the bloude of the peaceoffringes and the fatt, amonge the sonnes of Aaron, shall haue the ryght shoulder for his parte,
Lev.7.34	for the wauebrest and the heueshoulder haue I taken of the chyldren of Israel, euen of their peaceoffringes, and haue geuen it vnto Aaron Ꟶ vnto hys sonnes: by a statute for euer of the chyldren of Israel.
Lev.7.35	Thys is the anoyntynge of Aaron and the anoyntynge of his sonnes in the sacrifices of the Lorde, in the daye when he offered them to be Preastes vnto the Lorde.
Lev.7.36	And these be the sacrifyces which the Lord commaunded to be geuen them (in the daye of theyr anoyntynge) of the chyldren of Israel, by a statute for euer in theyr generacyons.
Lev.7.37	Thys is the lawe of the burntoffrynge and of the meatoffrynge, and of the sacrifyce for synne and trespace, for consecracyon Ꟶ for the peaceoffrynge:
Lev.7.38	which the Lorde commaunded Moses in the mount of Synai, when he commaunded the chyldren of Israel to offer their sacrifyces vnto the Lorde in the wyldernesse of Synai.

Lev.8.10	And Moses toke the anoyntynge oyle, and anoynted the Tabernacle, and all that was therin, and sanctified them,
Lev.8.11	and sprynkled therof vpon the alter seuen tymes, and anoynted the alter, and all hys vessels, the lauer Ꟶ his fote, to sanctifye them.
Lev.8.12	And he powred of the anoyntynge oyle vpon Aarons heed, and anoynted hym, to sanctifye hym.
Lev.8.13	And Moses brought Aarons sonnes, Ꟶ put albes vpon them, and gyrded them with gyrdels, Ꟶ put bonettes vpon their heedes: as the Lorde commaunded Moses.
Lev.8.14	And he brought the yonge oxe for synne, And Aaron and hys sonnes put theyr handes vpon the heed of the yonge oxe that was for synne.

Lev.8.16	And he toke all the fatt that was vpon the inwardes, and the abundaunce of the lyuer and the two kydneyes, and theyr fatt, Ꟶ Moses burned it vpon the alter.
Lev.8.17	But the yonge oxe and hys hyde, his flesh and his donge, he burnt wyth fyre without the hoste, as the Lorde commaunded Moses.
Lev.8.18	And he brought the ram for the burntoffrynge, and Aaron and hys sonnes put theyr handes vpon the heed of the ram,
Lev.8.19	which Moses kylled, and sprynkled the bloude vpon the alter rounde about,
Lev.8.20	and Moses cut the ram in peces and burnt the heed, the peces and the fatte,
Lev.8.21	and wasshed the inwardes Ꟶ the legges in water, and Moses burnt the ram euery whyt vpon the alter, for a burntsacrifyce, that it myght be a swete sauoure, and an offrynge vnto the Lorde, as the Lorde commaunded Moses.
Lev.8.22	And he brought the other ram, namely the ram of consecracyon Ꟶ Aaron and his sonnes put theyr handes vpon the heed of the ram:

Lev.8.24	And Moses brought Aarons sonnes, Ꟶ put of the bloude on the typpe of the ryghte eare of them, Ꟶ vpon the thombes of theyr ryghte handes, and vpon the greate tooes of theyr righte fete, and Moses sprinkled the bloude vpon the alter rounde aboute.
Lev.8.25	And he toke the fatte and the roumpe, and all the fat that was vpon the inwardes, and the aboundaunce of the lyuer, and the .ij. kydneyes wt theyr fatt, Ꟶ the ryghte shoulder.
Lev.8.26	And out of the basket of swete bread that was before the Lorde, he toke one swete cake of oyled bred, Ꟶ one wafer, Ꟶ put them on the fatt Ꟶ vpon the ryghte shoulder:
Lev.8.27	Ꟶ put altogether vpon Aarons handes, Ꟶ vpon hys sonnes handes, Ꟶ waued it a waue offrynge before the Lorde.
Lev.8.28	And Moses toke them from of their handes, Ꟶ burnt them vpon the alter, euen vpon the burntoffrynge alter: for it was the sacrifyce of consecracyon, for a swete sauoure Ꟶ a sacrifyce vnto the Lorde.
Lev.8.29	And Moses toke the breaste and waued it for a waue offrynge before the Lord, for it was of the ram of the consecration, and it was Moses parte, as the Lorde commaunded Moses.
Lev.8.30	And Moses toke of the anoyntynge oyle, and of the bloude whych was vpon the alter, and sprynkled it vpon Aaron and vpon hys vestimentes, vpon hys sonnes Ꟶ on hys sonnes vestimentes wyth him, and sanctyfyed Aaron, his vestures Ꟶ hys sonnes, Ꟶ hys sonnes vestures wyth hym.
Lev.8.31	And Moses sayde vnto Aaron and hys sonnes: boyle the fleshe in the dore of the tabernacle of witnesse, and there eate it wyth the bread that is in the basket of consecracyon, as I commaunded, sayinge: Aaron and hys sonnes shall eate it:
Lev.8.32	Ꟶ that whych remayneth of the bread, shall ye burne wyth fyre.
Lev.8.33	And ye shall not departe from the doore of the tabernacle of wytnesse .vij. dayes, vntyll the dayes of youre consecracyon be at an ende. For .vij. dayes shall he fyll youre hand
Lev.8.34	as he dyd thys daye: euen so the Lorde hath commaunded to do, to reconcyle you wyth all.
Lev.8.35	Therfore shall ye abide in the dore of the tabernacle of wytnesse daye and nyght seuen dayes longe: Ꟶ kepe the watche of the Lord, and ye shall not dye: for so I am commaunded.
Lev.8.36	And so Aaron Ꟶ his sonnes dyd all thynges whych the Lorde commaunded by the hande of Moses.
Lev.9.1	And it fortuned that in the eight daye, Moses called Aaron and hys sonnes, and the elders of Israel:
Lev.9.2	and sayde vnto Aaron: take the a calfe, a yonge one out of the droue, for synne, Ꟶ a ram for a burntoffrynge: both wythout blemysh, and brynge them before the Lorde.

Lev.9.15	And then he broughte the peoples offryng, takinge the goote that the people had for the sacrifyce of synne, and slewe it and offered it for synne, as he dyd the fyrst.
Lev.9.16	And brought the burntoffrynge, and offered it as the maner was

Lev.9.18	He slewe also the oxe Ꟶ the Ram for the peace offrynge, that the people had for them selues: and Aarons sonnes brought vnto hym the bloude, whych he sprynkled vpon the alter rounde about,
Lev.9.19	and toke the fatt of the oxe and of the Ram, the roumpe, and the fatt that couereth the inwardes and the kydneyes Ꟶ the abundaunce of the lyuer:
Lev.9.20	and they put the fatt vpon the brestes, and he burnt the fatt vpon the alter:
Lev.9.21	but the brestes and the ryght shoulders Aaron waued for a waueoffrynge before the Lorde, as the Lord commaunded Moses.
Lev.9.22	And Aaron lyfte vp hys hande ouer the people, and blessed them, and came doune from offrynge of the synne offringe, burntoffringes Ꟶ peace offrynges.
Lev.9.23	And Moses Ꟶ Aaron went in to the tabernacle of witnesse, Ꟶ came out, and blessed the people, and the glorye of the Lorde appered vnto all the people.
Lev.9.24	And there came a fyre out from before the Lorde, Ꟶ consumed vpon the alter the burntoffryng Ꟶ the fatt. Whych whan all the people sawe, they gaue thankes, and felle on theyr faces.
Lev.10.1	And Nadab and Abihu the sonnes of Aaron toke ether of them his censor, Ꟶ put fyre therin, Ꟶ put cens ther vpon, Ꟶ offred straunge fyre before the Lord whych he commaunded them not,
Lev.10.2	Ꟶ there went a fyre out from the Lorde, and consumed them, Ꟶ they dyed before the Lord.
Lev.10.3	Then Moses sayde vnto Aaron: thys is it that the Lorde spake sayinge: I wyll be sanctifyed in them that come nye me and before all the people I wilbe glorifyed. And Aaron helde hys peace.
Lev.10.4	And Moses called Misael and Elsapham the sonnes of Oziel the vncle of Aaron, and sayde vnto them: come on, carye youre brethren from the holy place out of the hoste.
Lev.10.5	And they went to them, and caryed them in theyr albes out of the hoste, as Moses had sayde.
Lev.10.6	And Moses sayde vnto Aaron and vnto Eleazar and Ithamar his sonnes vncouer not youre heedes, nether rent youre clothes, lest ye dye, and lest wrath come vpon all the people: But let youre brethren the hole housse of Israel bewepe the burnynge whych the Lord hath kyndled.
Lev.10.7	And go not ye out from the dore of the tabernacle of wytnesse, lest ye dye: for the anoyntynge oyle of God is vpon you. And they dyd as Moses sayde.
Lev.10.8	And the Lorde spake vnto Aaron, saying:
Lev.10.9	Thou shalt not drincke wyne Ꟶ stronge dryncke, thou and thy sonnes that are wyth the: when ye go into the tabernacle of wytnesse, lest ye dye. Let it be a lawe for euer thorowe out youre generacyons,

Lev.10.11	Ꟶ that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes whych the Lorde hath spoken vnto them by the hande of Moses.
Lev.10.12	And Moses sayde vnto Aaron and vnto Eleazar and Ithamar hys sonnes that were lefte: take the meatoffrynge that remayneth of the sacrifyces of the Lorde, and eate it wythout leuen besyde the alter, for it is most holy:
Lev.10.13	ye shall eate it in the holy place, because it is thy dutye and thy sonnes dutye of the sacrifyces of the Lorde: for so I am commaunded.

Lev.10.16	And Moses sought the goate that was offred for synne, and se, it was burnt. And he was angrye with Eleazar and Ithamar the sonnes of Aaron, whyche were lefte alyue, sayinge:
Lev.10.17	wherfore haue ye not eaten the synne offerynge in the holy place, seynge it is moost holye: and God hath geuen it you, to bere the synne of the congregacyon, to make agrement for them before the Lord?
Lev.10.18	Beholde, the bloud of it was not brought in within the holy place. Ye shulde haue eaten it in the holy place, as I commaunded.
Lev.10.19	And Aaron sayde vnto Moses: beholde, thys daye haue they offered theyr synneoffrynge and theyr burntoffrynge before the Lorde, and it is chaunced me after thys maner. And yf I had eaten the sacrifyce to daye, shulde it haue bene accepted in the syght of the Lorde?
Lev.10.20	And when Moses hearde that, he was content.
Lev.11.1	And the Lord spake vnto Moses and Aaron and sayde vnto them:
Lev.11.2	speake vnto the children of Israel, Ꟶ saye these are the beastes whych ye shall eate, amonge all the catell that are on the earth:
Lev.11.3	whatsoeuer parteth the hoofe, and deuydeth it into two clawes, and chaweth cud amonge the beastes, that shall ye eate.
Lev.11.4	Neuerthelesse, these shall ye not eate, of them that chewe cud, Ꟶ deuydeth the hoofes: as is the camell, whych chaweth cud, but he deuydeth not the hoofe, therfore is he vncleane vnto you,

Lev.26.9	For I will haue respect vnto you, and make you encrease and multiplye you, and sett vp my couenaunt with you.

Lev.26.13	I am the Lorde youre God, whyche broughte you out of the lande of Egypte, that ye shulde not be theyr bondemen, and I haue broken the cheynes of your yoke, and made you go vp ryghte.
Lev.26.14	But and yf ye wyll not harken vnto me, nor wyll do all these my commaundementes:
Lev.26.15	And yf ye shall despise myne ordinaunces, ether yf youre soule abhorre my lawes, so that ye wyll not do all my commaundementes, but breake myne appoyntment,
Lev.26.16	I also will do thys vnto you. For I will bring vpon you fearfulnesse, swellynge of body, and the burnynge agewe, to consume youre eyes, Ꟶ gendre sorowe of hert. And ye shall sowe youre seed in vayne, for youre enemyes shall eate it,
Lev.26.17	And I wyll set my face agenste you, and ye shall fall before youre enemyes, Ꟶ they that hate you, shall raygne ouer you and ye shall flee, when no man foloweth you.
Lev.26.18	And yf ye will not yet for all this herken vnto me, then will I punysh you seuen tymes more for youre synnes,
Lev.26.19	and wyll breake the pryde of youre stubburnesse. And I wyll make youre heauen as yron, and youre erth as brasse.
Lev.26.20	And youre laboure shalbe spent in vayne. For youre lande shall not geue hyr encrease, nether shall the trees of the lande geue theyr frutes.
Lev.26.21	And yf ye walke contrary vnto me, and wyll not herken vnto me, I wyll brynge seuen tymes moo plages vpon you, accordinge to youre synnes.
Lev.26.22	I will also sende in wilde beastes vpon you, which shall robbe you of youre children, and destroye youre catell, and make you fewe in nombre, and cause youre hye wayes to growe vnto a wyldernesse.
Lev.26.23	And yf ye maye not be refourmed by these thynges but shall walke contrarye vnto me,
Lev.26.24	then wyll I also walke contrarye vnto you, and wyll punish you yet seuen tymes for youre synnes.
Lev.26.25	And I wyll sende a swerde vpon you, that shall auenge my testament And when ye are gathered together wythin youre cyties, I wyll sende the pestilence amonge you, and ye shalbe delyuered into the hande of the enemye.
Lev.26.26	And when I haue broken the staffe of youre bread: ten wyues shall bake youre bread in one ouen, and they shall delyuer you youre bread agayne by weyght ye shall eate, and not be satisfyed.
Lev.26.27	And yf ye wyll not yet for all thys herken vnto me, but shall walke agaynst me,
Lev.26.28	I will walke contrarye vnto you also in indignacyon, and wyll chastice you seuen tymes for youre synnes.
Lev.26.29	And ye shall eate the flesh of youre sonnes and the fleshe of youre daughters shall ye deuoure.

Lev.26.31	And I wyll make your cyties desolate, and brynge youre sanctuarye vnto nought, and wyll not smell the swetnesse of youre odoures.
Lev.26.32	I wyll brynge the lande vnto a wyldernesse, and youre enemyes which dwell therin, shall wondre at it.
Lev.26.33	And I will strawe you amonge the hethen, and will drawe out a swerde after you, and youre lande shalbe wast, and youre cyties desolate.
Lev.26.34	Then shall the lande enioye her Sabbothes, as longe as it lyeth voyde, and ye shalbe in your enemyes lande: euen then shall the lande rest, and reioyse in her Sabbothes.
Lev.26.35	As longe as it lyeth voyde it shall rest, because it dyd not reste in youre Sabbothes, when ye dwelt vpon it.
Lev.26.36	And vpon them that are left alyue of you, I wyll sende a fayntnesse into theyr hertes in the lande of theyr enemyes: Ꟶ the sounde of a shakyng leef, shall chace them, and whan they flee the swerde, they shall fall: no man folowinge vpon them.
Lev.26.37	They shall fall one vpon another, as it were before a swerde, euen no man folowynge vpon them, and ye shall haue no power to stande before your enemyes:
Lev.26.38	And ye shall perish amonge the hethen, Ꟶ the lande of youre enemyes shall eate you vp.
Lev.26.39	And they that are left of you, shall pyne awaye in their vnryghteousnes, euen in their enemyes lande, and in the mysdeades of their fathers shall they consume.
Lev.26.40	And they shall confesse their misdeades and the mysdeades of their fathers for their trespace, which they haue trespaced agaynst me, and for that also that they haue walked contrarye vnto me.
Lev.26.41	Therfore I also wyll walke contrary vnto them, and wyll brynge them into the lande of their enemyes. And then at the leest waye their vncircumcysed hertes shall be tamed, and they shall make an attonement for their mysdeades.
Lev.26.42	And I will remembre my couenaunt, with Iacob, and my bonde with Isahac, and myne appointment with Abraham, and will thynke on the lande.
Lev.26.43	The lande shall be lefte of them, and shall enioye her Sabbothes, whyle she lyeth wast without them. And they shall make an attonement for their misdeades, because they despised my lawes, and because their soule refused myne ordinaunces:
Lev.26.44	And yet for all that when they be in the lande of their enemyes, I will not cast them awaye, neyther will abhorre them, to destroye them vtterly, and to breake myne appoyntment with them: for I am the Lorde their God.
Lev.26.45	I wyll for their sakes remembre the couenaunt made vnto their fathers, whom I brought out of the lande of Egypte in the syghte of the hethen, that I myght be their God: I am the Lorde.
Lev.26.46	These are the ordinaunces, and iudgementes, and lawes, which the Lorde made betwene him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai, by the hande of Moses.
Lev.27.1	And the Lord spake vnto Moses sayinge:
Lev.27.2	speake vnto the children of Israel, and saye vnto them: If any man will geue a synguler vowe vnto the Lord accordynge to the value of the soules,
Lev.27.3	the value of the male from twentye yeare olde vnto sixtye shalbe fyftie sycles of siluer, after the weyght of the sanctuary.
Lev.27.4	And yf it be a female, the value shalbe thyrtye sicles.
Lev.27.5	And from fyue yeares to twentye, the male shalbe set at twentye sicles, and the female at ten sycles.
Lev.27.6	And from a moneth vnto fyue yeare, the male shalbe set at fyue sycles of syluer, and the female at thre.
Lev.27.7	And he that is syxtie yeare olde, and aboue, shalbe valued at fiftene sicles, and the woman at ten.
Lev.27.8	But If he be to poore so to be set, he shall present himselfe before the preast: Ꟶ the preast shall value him, accordinge as the hande of him that vowed is able to gett, euen so shall the prest value him.
Lev.27.9	If it be a beaste of which men bringe an offrynge vnto the Lorde: all that any man geueth of soche vnto the Lorde, shalbe counted holy.
Lev.27.10	He shall not alter it nor chaunge it: a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. And yf he chaunge beast for beast, then both the same beast and it also wherwith it was chaunged shalbe holy.
Lev.27.11	If it be any maner of vnclene beast, of which men do not offer a sacrifyce vnto the Lord, he shall set the beast before the preast,
Lev.27.12	and the preast shall value it, whether it be good or bad. And as the preast setteth it, so shall it be.
Lev.27.13	But yf he will bye it agayne, he shall geue the fyft parte moare about that it was set at.
Lev.27.14	If any man dedicate his house, to be holy vnto the Lord, the preast shall set it, whether it be good or bad: and as the preast hath set it, so shall the value be.
Lev.27.15	And whan he that sanctifyed it wyll redeme hys house, lett hym geue the fyft parte of the money that it was iudged at therto, and it shalbe hys.
Lev.27.16	If a man halowe a pece of hys enhereted lande vnto the Lorde, it shalbe set accordynge to the sede therof. If it beare an homer of barlye, it shalbe set at fyftie sycles of syluer.
Lev.27.17	If he halowe his felde immediatly from the yeare of iubely, it shalbe worth accordinge as it is estemed.
Lev.27.18	But and yf he halowe hys felde after the Iubelye, the preast shall recken the money accordinge to the nombre of the yeares that remayne vnto the yeare of Iubely folowynge, Ꟶ there after it shall be lower sett.
Lev.27.19	If he that consecrated the felde, wyll redeme it agayne, let hym put the fyft parte of the pryce that it was set at there vnto,
Lev.27.20	and it shalbe hys, And yf he wyll not redeme the felde, but selleth the felde to another man, he maye redeme it nomore.
Lev.27.21	But when the felde goeth out in the yeare of iubelye, it shalbe made holy vnto the Lord: euen as a felde that is vtterly put awaye, and it shall be the preastes possessyon.
Lev.27.22	If a man sanctyfye vnto the Lord a felde, whych he hath boughte, and is not of his enheritaunce,
Lev.27.23	the preast shall reken vnto hym what it is worth vnto the yeare of iubelye, Ꟶ he shall geue the pryce that it is set at, the same daye, as a thynge consecrated vnto the Lorde.
Lev.27.24	And in the yeare of iubelye, the felde shall returne vnto him of whome he boughte it, euen to him, whose enheritaunce of land it is.
Lev.27.25	And all settynge shalbe accordynge to the cycle of the sanctuary. One sycle conteyneth twenye halfpens.
Lev.27.26	But the fyrst borne of the beastes that is appoynted vnto the Lorde, maye no man sanctifye: whether it be oxe or shepe, for it is the Lordes allredy.
Lev.27.27	If it be an vncleane beast, he shall redeme it, as it is sett at, and geue the fyfth parte moare therto: Or, yf it be not redemed, it shalbe solde, accordynge to the value.
Lev.27.28	Notwithstandynge, no damned thynge that a man putteth from hym and dedycateth vnto the Lorde, of all his good (whether it be man or beast or lande of hys enheritaunce) maye be sold or redemed: for euery thinge so put awaye, is most holy vnto the Lorde.
Lev.27.29	Let no damned thynge that a man separateth, be redemed, but dye the death.
Lev.27.30	Euery tyth of the lande whych is of the sede of the lande, or of the frute of the trees, is the Lordes, and is sanctified vnto the Lord.
Lev.27.31	And yf a man wyll redeme ought of hys tythes, let him adde the fifth parte therto.
Lev.27.32	And euery tyth of oxe and of shepe and of euery beest that goeth vnder the rodd euen euery tenth shalbe holy vnto the Lord.
Lev.27.33	He shall not loke yf it be good or bad, ner chaunge it. Els, yf he chaunge it, both it, and that it was chaunged withall, shalbe halowed vnto the Lorde, and maye not be redemed.
Lev.27.34	These are the commaundementes, whych the Lorde commaunded by Moses vnto the chyldren of Israel in mount Sinai.
Lev.0.0	¶ The ende of the thyrde boke of Moses called in the Hebrue Uaiecra, and in the Latyn. Leuiticus.
