Jer.0.0	¶ The boke of the prophete Ieremye.
Jer.1.1	These are the Sermons of Ieremy the sonne of Helkiah the Preste, one of them that dwelt at Anathoth in the lande of Ben Iamin:
Jer.1.2	when the Lorde had fyrst spoken with him, in the tyme of Iosiah the sonne of Amon kynge of Iuda, in the .xiij. yeare of his reygne:
Jer.1.3	and so durynge vnto the tyme of Iehoakim the sonne of Iosiah kynge of Iuda, and vntyll the .xi. yeare of zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah kynge of Iuda were ended: when Ierusalem was taken, euen in the fyfth Moneth.
Jer.1.4	The worde of the Lorde spake thus vnto me:
Jer.1.5	Before I fasshioned the in thy mothers wombe, I dyd knowe the. And or euer thou wast borne, I sanctifyed the, and ordeyned the, to be a prophete vnto the people.
Jer.1.6	Then sayde I: Oh Lorde God, I canne not speake, for I am yet but younge.
Jer.1.7	And the Lorde answered me thus: Saye not so, I am to younge: For thou shalt goo to all that I shall sende the vnto, and whatsoeuer I commaunde the, that shalt thou speake.
Jer.1.8	Be not afrayed of their faces, for I am with the, to delyuer the, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.1.9	And with that, the Lorde stretched oute his hande, and touched my mouth, Ꟶ the same lorde sayde vnto me. Behold, I put my wordes in thy mouth,
Jer.1.10	and beholde thys daye do I set the ouer the people Ꟶ kyngdomes: that thou mayest rote out, breake of, destroye, Ꟶ make waste: and that thou mayest buylde vp Ꟶ plante.
Jer.1.11	After this, the Lorde spake vnto me sayinge: Ieremy, what seyst thou? And I sayde: I se a rodde of an almond tree.
Jer.1.12	Then sayde the Lorde vnto me: thou hast sene right, for I wyll make haste spedelye vpon my worde, to perfourme it.
Jer.1.13	It happened afterwarde, that the Lorde spake to me agayne, and sayde: What seest thou? And I sayde: I do se a seethynge pot, lokynge from out of the north.
Jer.1.14	Then sayde the Lorde vnto me: Out of the north shall come a plage vpon all the dwellers of the lande.
Jer.1.15	For lo I wyll call all the kinredes of the kyngdomes of the north (sayeth the Lorde.) And they shall come, Ꟶ euery one shall sett his seate in the gates of Ierusalem, and in all their walles rounde aboute Ꟶ in all cyties of Iuda.
Jer.1.16	And thorowe them shall I declare my iudgement, vpon all the wyckednesse of those men that haue forsaken me: that haue burnt incense vnto straunge goddes, Ꟶ worshypped the workes of there awne handes.
Jer.1.17	And therfore girde vp thy loynes, aryse, and tell them all, that I geue the in commaundement. Feare them not, lest I destroye the before them.
Jer.1.18	For beholde, this daye do I make the a stronge fensed towne, an yron pyler, and a brasen wall agaynst the whole lande, agaynst the kynges and myghtye men of Iuda, agaynst the prestes and people of the lande.
Jer.1.19	They shall fyght agaynst the: but they shall not be able to ouercomme the for I am wyth the, to delyuer the, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.2.1	Moreouer, the worde of the Lorde came vnto me sayinge:
Jer.2.2	Go thy waye, crye in the eares of Ierusalem, Ꟶ saye: Thus sayeth the Lord: I remembre the, for the kyndenesse of thy youth, and because of thy stedfast loue: at the tyme of thy despousynge, in that thou folowdest me thorowe the wyldernesse, in an vntylled lande.
Jer.2.3	Israel was an halowed thynge vnto the Lorde, and so was his fyrst frutes. All they that deuoure Israel shall offende: mysfortune shall fall vpon them, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.2.4	Heare therfore the worde of the Lorde, O thou house of Iacob, and all the generacyons of the house of Israel.
Jer.2.5	Thus sayeth the Lorde. What vnfaythfulnesse founde youre fathers in me, that they wente so farre awaye fro me, fallynge to lightnesse, and beynge so vayne?
Jer.2.6	They thought not in their hertes. Where haue we left the Lorde, that brought vs oute of the lande of Egypte that led vs thorowe the wildernesse, thorowe a deserte Ꟶ rough lande, thorowe a drye and a deedly lande, yee, a lande that no man had gone thorowe, and wherin no man had dwelt.
Jer.2.7	And when I had brought you into a pleasaunt welbuylded lande, that ye myght enioye the frutes and all the commodyties of the same: ye went forth and defyled my lande, Ꟶ brought myne herytage to abhominacyon.
Jer.2.8	The Prestes them selues sayde not: Where is the Lorde? They that had the lawe in theyr handes, knewe me not: The shepherdes offended agaynst me. The prophetes dyd seruyce vnto Baal, Ꟶ folowed soch thynges as shall brynge them no profyt.
Jer.2.9	Wherfore, I am constrayned (sayeth the Lord) to make my complaynte vpon you, Ꟶ vpon youre childers chyldren.
Jer.2.10	Go in to the Iles of Cethim, and loke well: sende vnto Cedar, take diligent hede: and se, whether soch thynges be done there,
Jer.2.11	whether the Gentils them selues deale so falsly and vntruly wt their goddes, (which yet are no goddes in dede) But my people hath geuen ouer their hye honoure, for a thynge that maye not helpe them.
Jer.2.12	Be astonyshed (O ye heauens) be afrayde, Ꟶ abashed at soch a thinge, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.2.13	For my people hath done two euels. They haue forsaken me the well of the water of lyfe, and dygged them pyttes, yee vyle and broken pyttes, that can holde no water.
Jer.2.14	Is Israel a bonde seruaunt, or one of the housholde? Why then is he so spoyled?
Jer.2.15	Why do they roare and crye then vpon him, as a lyon? They haue made his lande waste, hys cyties are so brent vp, that there is no man dwellynge in them.
Jer.2.16	Yee, the chyldren of Noph and Taphnes haue defyled thy neck.
Jer.2.17	Commeth not this vnto the, because thou hast forsaken the Lorde thy God, euer sence he led the by the waye?
Jer.2.18	And what hast thou now to do in the strete of Egypte? to drincke the water of Nilus? Ether, what makest thou in the waye of Assyria? To dryncke water of the floude?
Jer.2.19	Thyne awne wickednesse shall reproue the, Ꟶ thy turnynge awaye shall condemne the: that thou mayest knowe Ꟶ vnderstande: howe euell and hurtfull a thynge it is, that thou hast forsaken the Lorde thy God, Ꟶ not feared him, sayeth the Lorde God of Hostes.
Jer.2.20	I haue euer broken thy yock of olde, Ꟶ burste thy bondes: yet sayest thou, I wyll nomore offend, but (lyke an harlot) thou runnest about vpon all hye hilles, Ꟶ amonge all grene trees,
Jer.2.21	where as I planted the as a noble vyne, Ꟶ a good rote whose seed is all faithfull. How art thou turned then in to a bytter, vnfrutefull, Ꟶ straunge grape?
Jer.2.22	Yee, Ꟶ that so sore: that though thou washe the wt Nitrus Ꟶ make thy selfe to sauoure with that swete smellinge herbe of Borith: yet in my syght thou art stayned wyth thy wyckednesse, sayeth the Lorde thy God.
Jer.2.23	Saye not nowe: I am not vnclene, and I haue not folowed Baal. Loke vpon thyne awne wayes in the woddes, valleys and dennes: so shalt thou knowe, what thou hast done. Thou art lyke a swyft Dromedary, that goeth easely his waye:
Jer.2.24	and thy wantonnes is lyke a wylde Asse, that vseth the wyldernesse, and that snoffeth and bloweth at his wyll. Who can tame the? All they that seke the shall not fayle, but fynde the in thyne awne vnclennes
Jer.2.25	Kepe thou thy fote from nakednes, and thy throte from thyrste, and without shame thou answerest. No, for I haue loued straungers and them will I folowe.
Jer.2.26	Lyke as a thefe that is taken with the dede commeth to shame, euen so is the house of Israel come to confusion: the comen people, their kynges and rulers, their prestes Ꟶ prophetes.
Jer.2.27	For they saye to a stocke, thou art my father, and to a stone: thou hast begotten me yee, they haue turned their backe vpon me, Ꟶ not their face. But in the tyme of their trouble, when they saye: stande vp, and helpe vs,
Jer.2.28	I shall answere them: Where are nowe thy goddes, that thou hast made the? lett them stande vp, Ꟶ helpe the in the tyme of nede? yf they be able. For loke howe many cyties thou hast (O Iuda) so many goddes hast thou also.
Jer.2.29	Wherfore then will ye goo to lawe with me, seynge yee all are synners agaynst me, sayeth the Lorde?
Jer.2.30	It is but lost laboure, that I smyte youre chyldren, for they receaue not my correccion. Youre awne swearde destroyeth youre prophetes, lyke a deuouringe lyon.
Jer.2.31	O ye people, loke vpon the worde of the Lorde. Am I then become a wyldernesse vnto the people of Israel? or a lande that hath no lyght? Wherfore sayeth my people then: we are Lordes, we will come no more vnto the?
Jer.2.32	Doth a mayden forget her rayment, or a bryde her stomacher? But as for my people they haue forget me, dayes innumerable.
Jer.2.33	Why boastest thou thy wayes so hylie (to optayne fauoure there thorowe) when thou hast yet stayned them with blasphemyes? and teachest thyne awne wayes.
Jer.2.34	Upon thy wynges is founde the bloude of poore and innocent people, Ꟶ that not in corners Ꟶ holes only, but openly in all these places.
Jer.2.35	Yet darest thou saye: I am gyltlesse. Tush, his wrath can not come vpon me. Beholde, I condempne the in iudgement, because thou darest saye: I haue not offended.
Jer.2.36	And why runnest thou so often to and fro, to chaunge thy wayes? For thou shalt be confounded, as well of Egypte, as of the Assyrians:
Jer.2.37	yee, thou shalt go thy waye from them, and smyte thyne handes together vpon thy head. Because the Lorde doth abhorre that confydence and hope of thyne, and thou shalt not prospere with all.
Jer.3.1	Comenly, when a man putteth awaye his wyfe, and she goeth from him Ꟶ marieth with another, then the questyon is: shulde he resorte vnto her eny more after that? Is not this felde then defyled and vncleane? But as for the, thou hast played the harlot with many louers, yet turne agayne to me, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.3.2	Lyft vp thyne eyes vnto the hilaulters Ꟶ loke, yf thou be not defyled with whoredome. Thou hast wayted for them in the stretes, and as a murtherer in the wyldernesse. Thorowe thy whordome Ꟶ shamefull blasphemyes, is the lande defyled.
Jer.3.3	This is the cause, that the rayne Ꟶ eueninge dewe hath ceased. Thou hast gotten the an whores forehead, and wilt not be ashamed.
Jer.3.4	Els woldest thou saye vnto me: O my father, thou art he that hast brought me vp, Ꟶ led me fro my youth:
Jer.3.5	Wylt thou then put me awaye, Ꟶ cast me of for euer? Or wilt thou withdrawe thy selfe cleane fro me? Neuertheles, thou speakest soch wordes, but thou art euer doinge worse and worse.
Jer.3.6	The Lorde sayde also vnto me: in the tyme of Iosiah the kynge: Hast thou sene what that rebellyon Israel hath done? howe she hath runne vp vpon all the hylles, and amonge all thick trees, and there played the harlot.
Jer.3.7	hast thou sene also (when she had done all thys) howe I sayde vnto her: that she shulde turne agayne vnto me, Ꟶ yet she is not returned? Iuda that vnfaythfull syster of hers also sawe thys:
Jer.3.8	Namely, that after I had well sene the aduoutrye of the shrynckyng harlot Israel, I put her awaye, and gaue her a byll of deuorcement. For all this, her vnfaythfull syster Iuda was not ashamed, but went backe Ꟶ played the whore also:
Jer.3.9	Yee, and the noyse of her whordome hath defyled the whole lande. For she hath commytted fornycacyon wyth stones and stockes.
Jer.3.10	Neuerthelesse, her vnfaythfull syster Iuda is not turned vnto me agayne wyth her whole herte, but faynedly, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.3.11	And the Lorde sayde vnto me: The backslyder Israell is more ryghtuous, then the vnfaythfull Iuda:
Jer.3.12	Ꟶ therfore go preache these wordes towarde the north, and saye: Thou disobedient Israell, turne agayne (sayeth the Lorde) Ꟶ I wyll not let my wrathe fall vpon you, for I am mercyfull (sayeth the Lorde) Ꟶ I wyll not alwaye beare displeasure agaynst the:
Jer.3.13	but this I will, that thou knowe thy greate blasphemy: Namely, that thou hast vnfaythfully forsaken the Lorde thy God, Ꟶ hast made thy selfe partake of straunge Goddes vnder all grene trees, but hast had no wyll to heare my voyce, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.3.14	O ye disobedient chyldren, turne agayne sayeth the Lorde: Ꟶ I wyll be maryed wyth you. For I wyll take one out of the cytie, Ꟶ two out of one generacyon, from amonge you, and brynge you in to Syon:
Jer.3.15	and wyll geue you herdmen after myne awne mynde, which shall fede you with learnynge and wysdome.
Jer.3.16	Moreouer, when ye be increased and multiplyed in the lande, then (sayeth the Lorde) there shall no more boast be made of the arcke of the Lordes testament: No man shall thinke vpon it, nether shall any man make mencyon of it: for from thence forth it shall nether be vysyted, ner honoured with gyftes.
Jer.3.17	Then shall Ierusalem be called the Lordes seate, Ꟶ all Heathen shalbe gathered vnto it, for the name of the Lordes sake, which shalbe set vp at Ierusalem. And from the tyme forth, they shall folowe no more the ymaginacyon of their awne frowarde herte.
Jer.3.18	Then those that be of the house of Iuda, shall go vnto the house of Israell: Ꟶ they shall come together out of the North, into the same lande that I haue geuen your fathers.
Jer.3.19	I haue shewed also, howe I toke the vp beynge but a childe Ꟶ gaue the a pleasaunt lande for thyne herytage, yee, Ꟶ a goodly Hoste of the Heathen, Ꟶ howe I commaunded the, that thou shuldest call me father only, and not to shryncke fro me.
Jer.3.20	But lyke as a woman vnfaythfully fayleth her husbande, so are ye vnfaythfull vnto me (O ye house of Israel) sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.3.21	And therfore the voyce of the chyldren of Israel was herde on hye, wepinge and waylinge: for they haue defyled their waye, and forgotten God their Lorde.
Jer.3.22	O ye disobedient chyldren, turne agayne (sayinge: lo, we are thyne, for thou art the Lorde oure God:) And so shall I heale youre backturninges.
Jer.3.23	Truly vaynly trusteth he for helth that loketh for it in the hylles and in vayne is it sought in the multitude of the mountaynes, but the health of Israell standeth only vpon God oure Lorde.
Jer.3.24	Confusyon hath deuoured oure fathers laboure from oure youth vp: yee, their shepe and bullockes, their sonnes and daughters.
Jer.3.25	So do we also slepe in oure confusyon, and shame couereth vs: for we Ꟶ oure fathers from oure youth vp vnto this daye haue synned agaynst the Lorde oure God, and haue not obeyed the voyce of the Lorde oure God.
Jer.4.1	O Israel, yf thou wylt turne the, then turne vnto me, sayeth the Lorde. And yf thou wylt put awaye thyne abhominacyons out of my syght, thou shalt not be moued:
Jer.4.2	And shalt sweare: The Lord lyueth: in trueth, in equyte and ryghteousnesse: and all people shall be fortunable Ꟶ ioyfull in him.
Jer.4.3	For thus sayeth the Lorde, to all Iuda Ꟶ Ierusalem: plowe your lande, and sowe not amonge the thornes.
Jer.4.4	Be circumcysed in the Lorde, and cut awaye the foreskynne of youre hertes, all yee of Iuda, and all the indwellers of Ierusalem: that my indignacyon breake not out lyke fyre and kyndle, so that no man maye quench it, because of the wyckednes of youre ymaginacyons.
Jer.4.5	Preach in Iuda and Ierusalem, crye out and speake: blowe the trompettes in the lande, crye that euery man maye heare gather together, Ꟶ saye: Gather you together, and we will go into stronge cyties.
Jer.4.6	Set vp the token in Syon, spede you, and make no tarienge: for I wyll bringe a greate plage, and a greate destruccyon from the north.
Jer.4.7	For the spoyler of the Gentyles is broken vp from his place, as a lyon out of his denne, that he maye make thy lande waste, and destroy the cyties, so that no man maye dwel therin.
Jer.4.8	Wherfore, gyrd your selues aboute with sacke clothe, mourne, and wepe, for the fearful wrath of the Lord is not withdrawen from vs.
Jer.4.9	At the same tyme (sayth the Lorde) the herte of the kynge and of the princes shall be gone, the preastes shalbe astonisshed, and the Prophetes shalbe sore afrayed.
Jer.4.10	Then sayd I: O Lorde God, hast thou then disceyued this people and Ierusalem, saying: ye shal haue peace, and nowe the swearde goeth thorowe theyr lyues:
Jer.4.11	Then shall it be sayde to the people Ꟶ Ierusalem: a stronge wynde in the hye places of the wyldernesse commeth thorow the waye of my people, but neyther to fan, nor to cleanse.
Jer.4.12	After that, shall there come vnto me a stronge wynde from those places, and then wyll I also gyue sentence vpon them.
Jer.4.13	For lo, he commeth downe lyke as a cloude, and his charrettes are lyke a stormye wynde: His horsemen are swyfter then the Egle. Woo vnto vs, for we are destroyed.
Jer.4.14	O Ierusalem, wash thyne hert from wickednesse, that thou mayest be helped. How long shal thy noysom thoughtes remayne with the?
Jer.4.15	For a voyce from Dan and from the hyl of Ephraim speaketh out, and telleth of a destruction.
Jer.4.16	Remembre the Heythen, and gyue Ierusalem warnyng, and preache vnto her, that watchers ouer her are commyng from far countryes. They haue cryed out agaynst the cities of Iuda.
Jer.4.17	And they haue beset her aboute in euery place lyke as the watchmen in the feld: For they haue prouoked me to wrath, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.4.18	Thy wayes and thy thoughtes, haue brought the vnto this, suche is thyne owne wyckednesse and disobedyence: and bycause it is a bytter thing, it hath striken the to the hert
Jer.4.19	Ah my bely, ah my bely, (shalt thou cry) how is my hert so sore? my hert panteth within me: I cannot be styll, for I haue herde the crying of the trompettes, and peales of warre.
Jer.4.20	They crye: murther vpon murther, the hole lande shal perish. Immediatlye, my tentes were destroyed, and my hangynges in the twynkelynge of an eye.
Jer.4.21	How longe shall I se the tokens of warre, and heare the noyse of the trompettes?
Jer.4.22	Neuerthelesse, this shall come vpon them, bycause my people is become foolysshe, and hath not knowen me. They are the children of foolysshnesse, and without any discretion. To doo euyll, they haue wyt ynoughe: but to doo well, they haue no wysdome.
Jer.4.23	I haue loked vpon the erth, and se: it was waste and voyde. I loked towarde heauen, and it had no shyne.
Jer.4.24	I behelde the mountaynes, and lo, they trembled, and all the hylles were in a feare.
Jer.4.25	I loked aboute me, and there was no bodye, and all the byrdes of the ayre were awaye.
Jer.4.26	I marked wel, and the plowed felde was become waste: yea, all theyr cyties were broken downe at the presence of the Lorde, and indignacion of his wrath.
Jer.4.27	For thus hath the Lorde sayd: The whole lande shalbe desolate, yet wil I not then haue done.
Jer.4.28	And therfore, shall the earth mourne, Ꟶ the heauen be sory aboue: for the thynge that I haue spoken to the Prophetes purposed and taken vpon me to do, shall not repent me, and I wil not go from it.
Jer.4.29	The hole lande shall flye, for the noyse of the horsemen and bowemen: they shal runne into tentes, into woddes, and clyme vp the stonye rockes. All the cyties shall be voyde, and noman dwellyng therin.
Jer.4.30	What wylt thou now do, thou beinge destroyed? For though thou clothest thy selfe with scarlet, Ꟶ deckest the wt golde: though thou payntest thy face with colours now, yet shalt thou trym thy selfe in vayne. For those that hytherto haue bene thy greate fauourers, shall abhorre the, and goo about to slaye the.
Jer.4.31	For I heare a noyse, lyke as it were of a woman trauaylynge, or one labourynge of her fyrst chylde: Euen the voyse of the doughter Syon, that casteth out her armes. and swowneth, saying: Ah woo is me, how sore vexed and faint is my hert, for feare of the murtherers?
Jer.5.1	Loke thorowe Ierusalem, beholde and se: Seke thorowe her stretes also within, if ye can fynde one man that doeth equall and ryght, or seketh for the truthe, and I shall spare that cytie (sayeth the Lorde)
Jer.5.2	For though they can saye: the Lorde lyueth, yet they sweare to disceyue.
Jer.5.3	Where as thou (O Lord) lokest onely vpon fayth and truthe. Thou hast scourged them, but they toke no repentaunce: thou hast corrected them for amendement, but they refused thy correction. They made theyr faces harder then a stone, and wolde not amende.
Jer.5.4	Therfore I thought in my selfe: peraduenture they are so symple and foolysshe, that they vnderstand nothing of the Lordes way, and iudgementes of our God.
Jer.5.5	Therfore, wyll I go vnto theyr heedes Ꟶ rulers, Ꟶ talke with them: yf they knowe the waye of the Lord and the iudgementes of oure God. But these (in lyke maner) haue broken the yocke, and burst the bondes in sondre.
Jer.5.6	Wherfore, a Lyon out of the woodde hath hurte them, and a wolfe in the euenynge shall destroye them. The Leoparde doth lye lurkynge by theyre cytyes, to teare in peces all them that come thereout. For theyr offences are multyplyed, and theyr departynge awaye is encreased.
Jer.5.7	Shulde I then for al this haue mercy vpon the? Thy chyldren haue forsaken me, and sworne by them that are no goddes. And albeit that I fed them to the ful yet they fall to aduoutrye, and haunt harlottes houses.
Jer.5.8	In the desyre of vnclenly lust they are become lyke the stoned horse euery man neyeth at his neyghbours wyfe:
Jer.5.9	Shulde I not correct this, sayth the Lorde? Shulde I not be auenged of euery people, that is lyke vnto this?
Jer.5.10	Clyme vp vpon theyr walles, beate them downe, but destroye them not vtterly, take away theyr foretresses, bycause they are not the Lordes:
Jer.5.11	For vnfaythfully hath the house of Israel and Iuda forsaken me, sayth the Lorde:
Jer.5.12	They haue denyed the Lorde, and sayde: it is not he that loketh vpon vs Tush, there shal no misfortune come vpon vs: we shall see nether swerde ner hunger.
Jer.5.13	As for the warnynge of the Prophetes they take it but for wynde, yea, there is none of these whiche wyll tell them, that such thinges shall happen vnto them.
Jer.5.14	Wherfore, thus sayth the Lorde God of hoostes: bycause ye speake suche wordes, beholde: The wordes that are in thy mouth wyl I turne to fyre, and make the people to be wood, that the fyre maye consume them.
Jer.5.15	Lo, I wyll bryng a people vpon you from farre, O house of Israel (sayeth the Lorde) a myghty people, an old people, a people whose speach thou knowest not, neyther vnderstandest what they saye.
Jer.5.16	Theyr arowes are sodayne death: yea, they them selues be verye gyauntes.
Jer.5.17	This people shal eate vp thy frute Ꟶ thy meate, yea, they shall deuoure thy sonnes Ꟶ thy doughters, thy shepe Ꟶ thy bulockes. They shall eate vp thy grapes, Ꟶ fygges. As for thy strong Ꟶ wel defensed cyties, wherin thou dyddest trust, they shall brynge to pouertie, and that thorowe the swerde.
Jer.5.18	Neuerthelesse I wyll not then haue done with you, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.5.19	But yf they saye: wherfore doth the Lorde our God all this vnto vs? Then auswer them: bycause, that lyke as ye haue forsaken me, and serued straunge goddes in your owne lande, euen so shall ye serue other goddes also in a straunge lande.
Jer.5.20	Preache this vnto the house of Iacob, and crye it out in Iuda, and saye thus:
Jer.5.21	Heare this (thou folish Ꟶ vndiscret people) ye haue eyes but ye se not: eares haue ye, but ye heare not.
Jer.5.22	Feare ye not me, sayth the Lorde? Are ye not asshamed to loke me in the face? whiche bynde the see with the sande, so that it cannot passe his boundes. For though it rage, yet can it do nothynge, and thoughe the waues therof do swell, yet maye they not go ouer.
Jer.5.23	But this people hath a false and obstinate hert, they are departed and gone away fro m
Jer.5.24	They thynke not in theyr hertes: O let vs feare the Lord our God, that giueth vs rayne earlye and late, when nede is: whiche kepeth euer styll the haruest for vs yerly.
Jer.5.25	Neuerthelesse, your mysdedes haue turned these from you, and your synnes haue robbed you hereof.
Jer.5.26	For amonge my people are founde wicked persones, that priuily lay snares Ꟶ wayte for men, to take them Ꟶ destroye them.
Jer.5.27	And lyke as a net is full of byrdes, so are theyr houses ful of that whiche they haue gotten with falshed and disceyte. Herof commeth theyr great substaunce and richesse,
Jer.5.28	herof are they fat and welthy, and are more mischeuous then any other. They mynistre not the lawe, they make no ende of the fatherlesse cause, yea, and they prospere: yet they iudge not the poore accordynge to equytie.
Jer.5.29	Shulde I not punish these thinges, sayth the Lord? shulde not I be auenged of all suche people as these be?
Jer.5.30	Horryble Ꟶ greuous thynges are done in the lande.
Jer.5.31	The prophetes teache falsely, and the preestes receyue gyftes, Ꟶ my people hath pleasure therin: What wil come therof at the last?
Jer.6.1	Come out of Ierusalem, ye stronge chyldren of BenIamin: blowe vp the trompettes ye Tecuytes, set vp a token vnto Bethcaran, for a plage and a greate myserye appeareth out from the North.
Jer.6.2	I wyll lyken the doughter Sion to a fayre and tendre woman, and to her shall come the shepherdes with theyr flockes.
Jer.6.3	Theyr tentes shall they pytche rounde about her, and euery one shall fede them that are vnder his hande.
Jer.6.4	Make battayle agaynst her (shall they saye) Aryse, let vs go vp, whyle it is yet daye. Alas, the daye goeth away, and the night shadowes fall downe:
Jer.6.5	Aryse: let vs go vp by nyght, Ꟶ destroye her stronge holdes,
Jer.6.6	for thus hath the Lorde of hoostes commaunded. Hewe downe her trees, and set vp bulworkes agaynst Ierusalem, for the tyme is come that this cytie must be punysshed: for in her is all maliciousnesse.
Jer.6.7	Lyke as a condyte spouteth oute waters, so she spouteth out her wickednesse. Robberye Ꟶ vnrightousnesse is herde in her sorowe and woundes are euer there in my syght.
Jer.6.8	Amend the (O Ierusalem) lest I withdrawe my hert from the, Ꟶ make the desolate: Ꟶ thy land also, that noman dwel in it.
Jer.6.9	For thus saith the Lorde of hoostes. The residue of Israel shalbe gathered, as the remnaunt of grapes. And therfore turne thyne hande agayne into the basket, lyke the grape gatherer.
Jer.6.10	But vnto whom shall I speake, whom shall I warne that he maye take hede? Their eares are so vncircumcised, that they maye not heare. Beholde, they take the worde of God but for a scorne, Ꟶ haue no lust therto.
Jer.6.11	And therfore, I am so full of thyne indignacyon, (O Lord) that I maye suffre no longer. But shede it out vpon the chyldren that are without, and vpon all yonge men. Yee, the man must be taken presoner with the wyfe, Ꟶ the aged wyth the crepel.
Jer.6.12	Theyr houses with theyr landes Ꟶ wyues shallbe turned vnto straungers, when I stretch out myne hande vpon the inhabitatours of this land, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.6.13	For from the leest vnto the most, they hange all vpon couetousnesse, Ꟶ from the prophete vnto the prest, they go all aboute with falsheed and lyes.
Jer.6.14	And besyde that, they heale the hurt of my people with swete wordes, sayeng: peace, peace, when there is no peace at all.
Jer.6.15	Were they ashamed when they hadd commytted abhomynacyon? Trulye nay they be past shame? And therfore they shall fall amonge the slayne, Ꟶ in the houre when I shall vyset them, they shall be brought downe, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.6.16	Thus sayeth the Lord: go into the streates, consydre Ꟶ make inquisicyon for the olde waye: and yf it be the good and ryght waye, then go therin, that ye maye fynde rest for youre soules. But they saye: we wyll not walcke therin,
Jer.6.17	and I wyll sett wacthmen ouer you, Ꟶ therfore take hede vnto the voyce of the trompett. But they saye: we wyll not take hede.
Jer.6.18	Heare therfore ye Gentyles, Ꟶ thou congregacyon shalt knowe, what I haue deuysed for them.
Jer.6.19	Heare thou earth also: behold, I will cause a plage to come vpon this people, euen the frute of their awne imaginacions. For they haue not bene obedient vnto my wordes Ꟶ to my lawe, but abhorred them.
Jer.6.20	Wherfore, bryng ye me incense from Saba, Ꟶ swete smellyng Calamus from farre countrees? Your burnt offerynges dysplease me, Ꟶ I reioyce not in your sacrifyces.
Jer.6.21	And therfore thus sayeth the Lorde: behold, I wyll make this people fall, and there shall fall from among them the father wt the chyldren, one neyghboure shall peryshe wyth another.
Jer.6.22	Thus sayeth the Lord, Beholde, there shal come a people from the North, Ꟶ a great people shal aryse from the endes of the earth,
Jer.6.23	with bowes and with dartes shall they be weapened. It is a rough Ꟶ fearce people, Ꟶ Ꟶ an vnmercyfull people, theyr voyce roareth lyke the see, they ryde vpon horses well apointed to the battaill agaynst the, O daughter Sion.
Jer.6.24	The crye of them haue we herde. Oure armes are feble, heuynesse Ꟶ sorowe is come vp on vs, as vpon a woman trauelyng with chylde.
Jer.6.25	Let no man go forth into the felde, let no man come vpon the hye strete: for the swearde and feare of the enemy is on euery syde.
Jer.6.26	Wherfore, gyrde a sack cloth aboute the (O thou daughter of my people) sprynkle thy selfe wt asshes, mourne Ꟶ wepe bitterly as vpon thy only beloued sonne. For the destroyer shal sodenly fall vpon vs.
Jer.6.27	The haue I set for a stronge tower (o thou prophete) Ꟶ a well fensed wall amonge my people, to seke out and to trye theyr wayes.
Jer.6.28	For they are all stubberne apostates and fallen awaye, walkinge disceitfully, they are cleane brasse Ꟶ yron, for they hurt Ꟶ destroye euery man.
Jer.6.29	The bellous are brent in the fyre, the leade is not molten, the melter melteth in vayne for the euell is not taken awaye from them.
Jer.6.30	Therfore do they call them naughty syluer, because the Lorde hath cast them out.
Jer.7.1	These are the wordes that God spake vnto Ieremye: sayenge.
Jer.7.2	Stande vnder the gate of the Lordes house, and crye out these wordes there wt a loude voyce, and saye. Heare the worde of the Lord all ye of Iuda, that go in at this dore, to worshyppe the Lorde.
Jer.7.3	Thus sayeth the Lord of Hostes the God of Israell. Amende youre wayes Ꟶ your councels, and I wyll let you dwell in this place.
Jer.7.4	Trust not in false lyenge wordes, sayeng: here is the temple of the Lord, here is the temple of the Lord, here is the temple of the Lorde.
Jer.7.5	But rather in deade amende your wayes and councels, and iudge ryght betwixte a man and his neyghbour:
Jer.7.6	oppresse not the straunger, the fatherles, Ꟶ the wyddowe: shede not innocent bloud in thys place: cleue not to straunge goddes to your awne destruccion:
Jer.7.7	then wyll I let you dwell in this place, yee, in the land that I gaue afore tyme vnto youre fathers for euer.
Jer.7.8	But take hede: ye trust in lyinge tales, that begyle you Ꟶ do you no good.
Jer.7.9	For when ye haue stollen, murthured, commytted aduoutry, Ꟶ periury. When ye haue offred vnto Baal, folowyng straunge Ꟶ vnknowne goddes shall ye be vnpunyshed?
Jer.7.10	Yet then come ye, Ꟶ stande before me in this house, (which hath my name geuen vnto it) Ꟶ saye. Tush, we are absolued quite, thoughe we haue done all these abhominacyons.
Jer.7.11	What? thyncke you this house that beareth my name, is a denne of theues? And yea I se what you thynke, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.7.12	Go to my place in Siloh, wherunto I gaue my name a fore tyme, and loke well what I dyd to the same place for the wyckednes of my people of Israell.
Jer.7.13	And nowe, though ye haue done all these dedes (sayeth the Lorde) and I my self rose vp euer by tymes to warne you Ꟶ to comen with you, yet wolde ye not heare me. I called, ye wolde not answere.
Jer.7.14	And therfore, euen as I haue done vnto Siloh, so wyll I do to thys house, that my name is geuen vnto (Ꟶ that ye put youre trust in) ye vnto the place that I haue geuen to you and your fathers.
Jer.7.15	And I shal thrust you out of my syght, as I ha e cast out all youre brethren the whole sede of Ephraim.
Jer.7.16	Therfore, thou shalt not praye for thys people, thou shalt nether geue thanckes, nor byd prayer for them: thou shalt make no intercession to me for them, for in no wyse wyll I heare the.
Jer.7.17	Seyst thou not what they do in the cyties of Iuda, Ꟶ in the streats of Ierusalem.
Jer.7.18	The chyldren gather styckes, the fathers kyndle the fyre, the women kneade the dowghe, to bake cakes for the quene of heauen. They poure out drynckoffrynges vnto straunge goddes, to prouok me vnto wrath.
Jer.7.19	Howbeit they hurte not me (sayeth the lord) but rather confounde, Ꟶ shame them selues.
Jer.7.20	And therfore thus sayeth the Lord God: behold, my wrath Ꟶ my indignacion shalbe poured out vpon this place, vpon men Ꟶ catell vpon the trees in the felde Ꟶ frute of the lande, Ꟶ it shall burne so that no man maye quench it.
Jer.7.21	Thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes the God of Israel: Heape vp your burnt offrynges wyth your sacrifyces, and eate the fleshe.
Jer.7.22	For when I brought youre fathers out of Egypt, I spake no worde vnto them of burnt offrynges Ꟶ sacryfyces:
Jer.7.23	but this I commaunded them, sayinge: herken Ꟶ obeye my voyce, and I shalbe youre God, and ye shall be my people: so that ye walcke in all the wayes, whych I haue commaunded you, that ye maye prospere.
Jer.7.24	But they were not obedient, they inclyned not theyr eares there vnto, but went after theyr awne ymagynacyons Ꟶ after the mocyons of theyr awne wycked herte, Ꟶ so turned them selues awaye, and conuerted not vnto me.
Jer.7.25	And this haue they done, from the tyme that youre fathers came out of Egypt, vnto thys daye. Neuertheles, I sent vnto you, all my seruauntes the prophetes. I rose vp early, Ꟶ sent you worde,
Jer.7.26	yet wolde they not herken, ner offre me theyr eares, but were obstynate, Ꟶ worse then theyr fathers.
Jer.7.27	And thou shalt now speake al these wordes vnto them, but they shall not heare the: thou shalt crye vpon them, but they shall not answere the.
Jer.7.28	Therfore, shalt thou saye vnto them: this is the people, that nether heareth the voyce of the Lorde theyr God, ner receaueth hys correccyon. Faythfulnesse and treuth is cleane roted out of theyr mouth.
Jer.7.29	Wherfore cut of thyne hearre O Ierusalem, Ꟶ cast it awaye, take vp a complaynte on hye, for the Lord hath cast awaye, and scatred the people that he is displeased withall.
Jer.7.30	For the chyldren of Iuda haue done euell in my syght, sayeth the Lord. They haue set vp theyr abhominacyons, in the house that hath my name, and haue defyled it.
Jer.7.31	They haue also buylded an aulter at Topheth, which is in the valley of the chyldren of Hennom: that they myght burne theyr sonnes Ꟶ daughters in fyre, which I neuer commaunded them, nether came it euer in my thought.
Jer.7.32	And therfore beholde, the dayes shall come (sayeth the Lorde) that it shall nomore be called Topheth, or the valley of the chyldren of Hennom, but the valley of slaughter, for in Topheth, they shalbe buried, because they shall els haue no rowme.
Jer.7.33	Yee, the deed bodyes of this people shalbe eaten vp of the foules of the ayre Ꟶ wylde beastes of the erth, and no man shall fraye them awaye.
Jer.7.34	And as for the voyce of myrth Ꟶ gladnes of the cytyes of Iuda, Ꟶ Ierusalem, the voyce of the brydegrome, and of the bryde. I wyll make them ceasse, for the lande shalbe desolate.
Jer.8.1	At the same tyme sayeth the Lorde, the bones of the kynges of Iuda, the bones of his prynces, the bones of the prestes Ꟶ prophetes, yee, Ꟶ the bones of the cytezins of Ierusalem, shall be brought out of theyr graues
Jer.8.2	Ꟶ layed agaynst the Sunne, the Moone Ꟶ all the heauenly hoost: whom they loued, whom they serued, whom they ranne after, whom they sought and worshypped. They shall nether be gathered together ner buryed, but shall lye as donge vpon the earth, to theyr shame and despysynge.
Jer.8.3	And all they that remayne of this wycked generacion, shall desyre rather to dye then to lyue: wheresoeuer they remaine, and whereas I scatre them, sayeth the Lord of hostes.
Jer.8.4	Thys shalt thou saye vnto them also. Thus sayeth the Lorde. Do men fall so, that they aryse not vp agayne? Or yf Israell repent, wyll not god turne ageyn to them?
Jer.8.5	Wherfore then is this people Ꟶ Ierusalem gone so farre backe, that they turne not agayne? They are euer the longer the more obstinat, and wyll not be conuerted.
Jer.8.6	For I haue loked, Ꟶ consydered: but there is no man that speaketh a good word: there is no man that taketh repentaunce for hys synne, that wyll so moch as saye: wherfore, haue I done thys? But euery man (as soone as he is turned backe) runneth forth styll, lyke a wylde horse in a battayll.
Jer.8.7	The Storke in the ayer knoweth hys apoynted tyme, the Turtle doue the Swalow Ꟶ the Crane consydre the tyme of theyr trauayll, but my people wyll not knowe the tyme of the punyshment of the Lorde.
Jer.8.8	How darre ye saye then, we are wyse, we haue the lawe of the Lorde amonge vs? Suerly in vayne hath he prepared his penne, Ꟶ vaynly haue the wryters wryten it:
Jer.8.9	therfore shall the wyse be confounded, they shalbe afrayed Ꟶ taken: for lo, they haue cast out the worde of the Lorde: what wysdome can then be amonge them?
Jer.8.10	Wherfore, I wyll geue theyr wyues vnto aleauntes, and theyr feldes to destroyers. For from the lowest vnto the hyest, they folowe all filthy lucre: Ꟶ from the Prophete vnto the preste, they deale all wt lyes.
Jer.8.11	Neuerthelesse, they heale the hurte of my people very slenderlye, sayenge: peace, peace, where there is no peace at all.
Jer.8.12	Fye for shame, how abhominable thynges do they? and yet they be not ashamed, yee, they knowe of no shame. Wherfore, in the tyme of theyr visytacion, they shall fall amonge the deed bodyes, Ꟶ be ouerthrowne sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.8.13	Moreouer, I wyll consume them in deade (sayeth the Lord) so that there shall not be one grape vpon the vyne, nether one fygg vpon the fyge tre, and the leaues shalbe plucte of. And the thynge that I haue gyuen them shall be taken from them:
Jer.8.14	why prolonge we the tyme? Let vs gather oure selues together, and go into the stronge cytie, there shall we be in rest. For the Lorde oure God hath put vs to sylence, Ꟶ geuen vs water mixte wt gall, to dryncke: because we haue synned agaynst hym.
Jer.8.15	We loked for peace, Ꟶ we fare not the better, we wayted for the tyme of health, Ꟶ lo, here is nothynge but trouble.
Jer.8.16	The noyse of his horsses is hearde from Dan, the whole lande is afrayed at the neyenge of his stronge horsses: for they are come in, Ꟶ haue deuoured the lande, wt all that is in it: the cyties, and those that dwell therin.
Jer.8.17	Moreouer, I wyll sende Cockatrices Ꟶ serpentes amonge you (which wyll not be charmed) Ꟶ they shall byte you, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.8.18	I wolde haue had comforte agenst sorowe: but sorowe is come vpon me, and heuynes vexeth my hert:
Jer.8.19	for lo, the voyce of the cryenge of my people is herde for feare of them, that come from a farre countre. Is not the Lorde in Syon? Is not the Kyng, in her? Wherfore then haue they greued me (shall the Lorde saye) wt theyr ymages Ꟶ foolysh straunge fashyons of a foreyne god?
Jer.8.20	The haruest is gone, the Sommer hath an ende, Ꟶ we are not helped.
Jer.8.21	I am sore vexed, because of the hurte of my people. I am heuy Ꟶ abashed,
Jer.8.22	is ther no triacle at Gilead? Is ther no physycyon ther? Why then is not the helthe of my people recouered?
Jer.9.1	O who wyll geue my head water ynough, and a wel of teares for myne eyes: that I maye wepe night and daye: for the slaughter of my people?
Jer.9.2	Wolde God, that I had a cotage some where farre from folcke, that I myght leaue my people, and goo from them: for they be all aduoutrers Ꟶ a shrynckynge sorte.
Jer.9.3	They bende theyr tunges lyke bowes, to shote out lyes. They wax stronge vpon erthe. As for the trueth, they maye nothynge awaye with all in the worlde. For they go from one wyckednes to another, and wyll not knowe me, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.9.4	Yee, one must kepe hym selfe from another, no man may safely trust his awne brother: for one brother vndermyndeth another, one neyghboure begileth another.
Jer.9.5	Yee one dissembleh wt another, and they deale wt no trueth. They haue practysed theyr tunges to lye, Ꟶ taken great paynes to do mischefe.
Jer.9.6	Thou syttest in the myddes of a dysceatfull people, which for very dissemblyng falshede, wyll not knowe me, sayeth the Lord.
Jer.9.7	Therfore, thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes: beholde, I wyll melte them, and trye them, for what shuld I els do to my people.
Jer.9.8	Theyr tunges are lyke sharpe arowes, to speake dysceate. Wyth theyr mouth they speake peaceably to theyr neyghboure, but preuely they laye wayte for hym.
Jer.9.9	Shulde I not punysh them for these thynges, sayeth the Lorde? Or shulde I not be auenged of any soche people as thys?
Jer.9.10	Upon the mountaines will I take vp a lamentacion Ꟶ a sorowful crie, Ꟶ a mourninge vpon the fayre playnes of the wildernesse. Namely, how they are so brente vp, that no man goeth there any moore. Yee, a man shall not heare one beaste crye there. Byrdes Ꟶ catell are all gone from thenc
Jer.9.11	I will make Ierusalem also an heape of stones, Ꟶ a denne of venymous wormes. And I will make the cyties of Iuda so waste, that no man shall dwell therin.
Jer.9.12	What man is so wyse, as to vndestande thys? Or to whom hath the Lord spoken by mouth, that he may shewe this, Ꟶ saye. O thou lande, why perishest thou so? Wherfore art thou so brent vp, Ꟶ lyke a wyldernes, that no man goeth thorow?
Jer.9.13	Yee, the Lorde hym selfe tolde the same vnto them, that forsoke hys lawe, Ꟶ kepte not the thynge that he gaue them in commaundement, nether lyued therafter:
Jer.9.14	but folowed the wickednes of theyr awne hertes, Ꟶ serued straunge Goddes, as theyr fathers taught them.
Jer.9.15	Therfore, thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes, the God of Israel. Beholde, I wyll fede this people wt wormwod, Ꟶ geue them gall to dryncke,
Jer.9.16	I wyll scatre them also among the Heathen, whom nether they ner theyr fathers haue knowne: Ꟶ I will sende a swearde amonge them, to persecute them, vntill I bryng them to naught.
Jer.9.17	Moreouer, thus sayeth the Lord of Hostes. Beware of the vengeaunce that hangeth ouer you: and cal for mourning wyues, Ꟶ sende for wyse wemen: that they come shortly,
Jer.9.18	and synge a mournynge songe of you: that the teares may fall out of oure eyes, and that our eye lyddes maye gusshe out of water.
Jer.9.19	For there is a lamentable noyse hearde of Sion. O how are we so sore destroyed? O how are we so pyteously confounded? We must forsake our awne naturall countre, Ꟶ we are shut out of oure awne lodgynges.
Jer.9.20	Yet heare the worde of the Lorde (O ye wemen) Ꟶ let youre eares regarde the wordes of his mouth: that ye may lerne youre daughters to mourne, Ꟶ that euery one may teach her neyghbouresse, to make lamentacyon.
Jer.9.21	Namely thus: Death is clymynge vp in at oure wyndowes, he is come into oure houses, to destroye the chylde before the dore, and the yonge man in the strete.
Jer.9.22	But tell thou playnely, thus sayeth the Lorde. The deed bodyes of men shall lye vpon the grounde, as the donge vpon the felde, Ꟶ as the heye after the mower, Ꟶ ther shalbe no man to take them vp.
Jer.9.23	Thus sayeth the Lorde. Let not the wyse man reioyse in his wysdome, ner the strong man in his strength, nether the ryche man in his rychesse.
Jer.9.24	But who so will reioyse, let hym reioyse in this, that he vnderstandeth, Ꟶ knoweth me: for I am the Lorde, which do mercy, equyte and ryghteousnesse vpon the earth. Therfore, haue I pleasure in soch thynges, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.9.25	Beholde, the tyme commeth (sayeth the Lorde) that I wyll vyset all them, whose fore skynne is vncircumcysed.
Jer.9.26	The Egyptians, the Iewes, the Edomytes, the Ammonytes, the Moabites. and the shauen Madianytes, that dwell in the wyldernes. For all the Gentiles are vncircumcysed in the flesh, but all the house of Israell are vncircumcysed in the herte.
Jer.10.1	Heare the worde of the Lorde that he speaketh vnto the, O thou house of Israel.
Jer.10.2	Thus sayeth the Lorde. Ye shall not lerne after the maner of the Heathen, Ꟶ ye shall not be afrayed for the tokens of heauen: for the Heathen are afrayed of soch:
Jer.10.3	yee, al the customes and lawes of the Gentyles are nothynge, but vanyte. They hewe downe a tree in the wod with the handes of the worckeman, and fashyon it wt the axe:
Jer.10.4	they couer it ouer with golde or siluer, they fasten it with nayles Ꟶ hammers, that it moue not.
Jer.10.5	It standeth as styf as the palme tree, it can nether speake ner go one fote, but must be borne. Be not ye afrayed of soch, for they can do nether good ner euell.
Jer.10.6	But there is none lyke vnto the, O Lorde, Ꟶ great is the name of thy power.
Jer.10.7	Who wolde not feare the? O kyng of the Gentils for thyne is the domynion. For amonge all the wyse men of the Gentyles, and in all theyr kyngdomes, there is none that maye be lickened vnto the.
Jer.10.8	They are all together vnlerned Ꟶ vnwyse in this one thynge. All theyr connynge is but vanyte:
Jer.10.9	namely, wod, syluer, which is brought out of Tharsis, Ꟶ beaten to plates: and golde from Ophir, a worcke that is made with the hande of the craftesman Ꟶ the caster, clothed wt yelow sylck Ꟶ scarlet: euen so is the worcke of theyr wyse men all together.
Jer.10.10	But the Lorde is a true God, a lyuynge God, Ꟶ an euerlastynge kynge. If he be wroth, the earth shaketh: all the Gentyles maye not abyde his indygnacyon.
Jer.10.11	As for theyr goddes thus shall you saye to them: they are goddes, that made nether heauen ner earth therfore shall they perysh from the earth, and from all thynges vnder heauen.
Jer.10.12	But (as for oure God) He made the earth wt his power, and with his wysdome doth he order the whole compasse of the worlde, with his discrecyon hath he spred out the heauens.
Jer.10.13	At his voyce the waters gather togethe in the ayre, he draweth vp the cloudes from the vttemost partes of the earth: he turneth lyghtenyng to rayne, Ꟶ bryngeth forth the wyndes out of their treasures.
Jer.10.14	His wysdome maketh all men fooles. And confounded be all casters of ymages, for that they cast, is but a vayne thynge, Ꟶ hath no lyfe.
Jer.10.15	The vayne craftesmen wt their worckes, that they in their vanyte haue made, shall perysh one wt another in the tyme of visitacyon.
Jer.10.16	Neuertheles, Iacobs porcyon is no soch: but it is he, that hath made all thynges, Ꟶ Israel is the rodd of his inherytaunce. The Lorde of Hostes is his name.
Jer.10.17	Gather vp thy wares out of the land, thou that art in the stronge place.
Jer.10.18	For thus sayeth the Lord. Behold, I wyll now throwe as wt a stone slynge the inhabitours of this lande: at this once, and I wyll brynge trouble vpon them, that they shall proue trewe the wordes that I haue spoken by the prophetes.
Jer.10.19	Alas, how am I hurt? Alas how paynefull are my scourges vnto me? For I consydre this sorow by my self, and I must suffre it.
Jer.10.20	My tabernacle is destroyed, and all my coardes are broken. My chyldren are gone fro me, Ꟶ can no where be founde. Now haue I none to sprede out my tent, or to set vp my hangynges.
Jer.10.21	For the herdmen haue done folyshly, that they haue not sought the Lord. Therfore, haue they dealt vnwysely with theyr catell, Ꟶ all are scatred abrode.
Jer.10.22	Beholde, the noyse is harde at hand, Ꟶ great sedicyon out of the north: to make the cyties of Iuda a wyldernes, Ꟶ a dwellynge place for Dragons.
Jer.10.23	Now I knowe (O Lorde) that it is not in mans power to ordre hys awne wayes, or to rule his awne steppes Ꟶ goyngges.
Jer.10.24	Therfore, chasten thou vs, o Lord, but with fauoure Ꟶ not in thy wrath, bryng vs not vtterly to naught.
Jer.10.25	Poure out thyne indygnacyon rather vpon the Gentiles, that knowe the not, Ꟶ vpon the people that call not on thy name. And that because they haue consumed, deuoured and destroyed Iacob, and haue made his habytacyon waist.
Jer.11.1	Thys is another Sermon, whych the Lorde commaunded Ieremy for to preach, saying:
Jer.11.2	Heare the wordes of the couenaunt, Ꟶ speake vnto the men of Iuda, Ꟶ to all them that dwell at Ierusalem.
Jer.11.3	And saye thou vnto them. Thus sayeth the Lord God of Israell: Cursed be euery one that is not obedient vnto the wordes of this couenaunt:
Jer.11.4	whych I commaunded vnto youre fathers, what tyme as I broughte them out of Egipt, from the yron fornace, saying: Be obedient vnto my voyce, Ꟶ do acordynge to all that I commaunde you: so shall ye be my people, Ꟶ I wilbe youre God,
Jer.11.5	and wyll kepe my promyse, that I haue sworne vnto youre fathers. Namely, that I wolde geue them a lande which floweth wt mylck Ꟶ hony: as ye se, it is come to passe vnto this day. Then answered I, and sayd: Amen. Let it be euen so Lorde, as thou sayest.
Jer.11.6	Then the Lorde sayde vnto me agayne: Preache this in the cyties of Iuda Ꟶ rounde aboute Ierusalem, Ꟶ saye. Heare the wordes of this couenaunt, that ye maye kepe them.
Jer.11.7	for I haue diligently exhorted your fathers, euer sence the tyme that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, vnto this daye. I gaue them warnyng by tymes, saying: herken vnto my voyce.
Jer.11.8	Neuertheles, they wolde not obeye me, nor encline theyr eares vnto me, but folowed the wicked ymaginacions of theyr awne hertes. And therfore, I haue accused them as transgressours of all the wordes of this couenaunt, that I gaue them to kepe which they (notwithstandinge) haue not kepte.
Jer.11.9	And the Lorde sayde vnto me. It is founde out, that whole Israel and all these citezins of Ierusalem are gone backe.
Jer.11.10	They haue turned them selues to the blasphemyes of theyr forefathers, which had no lust to heare my worde. Euen lykewyse haue these also folowed straunge goddes, and worshypped them. The house of Israel Ꟶ Iuda haue broken my couenaunt, which I made with theyr fathers.
Jer.11.11	Therfore, thus sayeth the Lord. Behold, I wyll sende a plage vpon them, which they shall not be able to escape: Ꟶ thoughe they crye vnto me, I wyl not heare them.
Jer.11.12	Then shall the townes of Iuda Ꟶ the citezins of Ierusalem go, Ꟶ call vpon theyr goddes vnto whom they made theyr oblacyons: but they shall not be able to helpe them in tyme of theyr trouble.
Jer.11.13	For as many cyties as thou hast, O Iuda, so many goddes hast thou had also. And loke how many stretes there be in the, (O Ierusalem) so many shamefull aulters haue ye set vp, aulters I saye to offre vpon them vnto Baal.
Jer.11.14	Therfore, praye not thou for this people, byd nether prayse ner prayer for them, for though they crie vnto me in theyr trouble, yet will I not heare them.
Jer.11.15	What parte hath my beloued in my house, seinge he hathe worked abominacion seruynge many goddes? The holy fleash offringes in the temple ar goone from the O Iuda, and thou when thou hast done euell makest thy boast of ytt.
Jer.11.16	The Lorde called the a grene olyue tre, a fayre one, a frutefull one, a goodly one: but with greate clamor hath the enemy sett fyre vppon it and the branches of yt are destroyed.
Jer.11.17	For the Lorde of Hoostes that planted the, hath deuysed a plage for the (O thou house of Israell and Iuda) for the euell that ye haue done to prouoke hym to wrath, in that ye dyd seruyce vnto Baal.
Jer.11.18	This (O Lord) haue I lerned of the, and vnderstand it, for thou hast shewed me theyr ymaginacyons.
Jer.11.19	But I am (as a meke lambe an oxe) that is caryed awaye to be slayne, not knowynge, that they had deuysed soch a councell agaynst me, sayeng: We wyll destroye his meate with wodd, Ꟶ dryue him out of the land, of the lyuyng: that his name shall neuer be thought vpon.
Jer.11.20	Therfore, I will beseche the now (O Lord of hoostes) thou ryghteous iudge, thou that tryest the reynes Ꟶ the hertes: lett me se the auenged of them, for vnto the haue I committed my cause.
Jer.11.21	The Lorde therfore spake thus of the cytezins of Anathoth, that sought to slaye me, sayenge: Preache not vnto vs in the name of the Lord, or els thou shalt dye of our handes.
Jer.11.22	Thus (I saye) spake the Lorde of hoostes. Behold, I wyll vyset you. Youre younge men shall perysh with the swearde, your sonnes Ꟶ your daughters shall vtterly dye of honger,
Jer.11.23	so that none shall remayne. For vpon the cytezins of Anathoth will I bryng a plage, euen the yeare of theyr vysytacyon.
Jer.12.1	O Lorde, thou art more ryghteous, then that I shulde dispute wt the. Neuertheles, lett me talke with the in thynges reasonable. How happeneth it, that the waye of the vngodly is so prosperous? Ꟶ that it goeth so well with them, whych (wythout any shame) offende Ꟶ lyue in wickednes?
Jer.12.2	Thou plantest them, they take rote, they growe, Ꟶ brynge forth frute. They boast moch of the, yet art thou farre from ther reynes.
Jer.12.3	But thou Lorde (to whom I am well knowne) thou that hast sene, Ꟶ proued my herte, take them awaye, lyke as a flock is caryed to the slaughter house, and apointe them for the daye of slaughter.
Jer.12.4	How longe shall the lande mourne, and all the herbes of the felde perish, for the wyckednes of them that dwell therin. The catell and the byrdes are gone, yet say they tush, God wyll not destroye vs vtterly.
Jer.12.5	Seyng, thou art weery in runnyng with the fote men, how wilt thou then runne with horses? In a peaceable sure lande thou mayest be safe, but how wilt thou do in the furyous pryde of Iordane?
Jer.12.6	For thy brethren Ꟶ thy kynred haue all together despysed the, and cryed out vpon the in thyne absence. Beleue them not, though they speake fayre wordes to the.
Jer.12.7	As for me (I saye) I haue forsaken myne awne dwellyng place, Ꟶ left myne heritage. My lyfe also that I loue so wel, haue I geuen into the handes of myne enemies.
Jer.12.8	Myne heritage is become vnto me, as a Lyon in the wood. It cryed out vpon me, therfore, haue I forsaken it.
Jer.12.9	Myne herytage is vnto me, as a speckled byrde, a byrde of dyuerse coloures is vpon it. Come, Ꟶ gather ye to geather al the beastes of the felde. Come that ye maye eate it vp.
Jer.12.10	Diuerse herdmen haue broken downe my vyneyarde, and troden vpon my porcyon. Of my pleasaunt porcyon, they haue made a wyldernes and desert.
Jer.12.11	They haue layed it waste: Ꟶ now that it is waste, it sigheth vnto me. Yee, the whole land lyeth waste, Ꟶ no man regardeth it.
Jer.12.12	The destroyers come ouer the heeth euery waye, for the sweard of the Lorde doth consume from the one ende of the land to the other, Ꟶ no flesh hath rest.
Jer.12.13	They haue sowen wheate, Ꟶ reaped thornes. They haue taken herytage in possessyon, but it doth them no good. And the prophets were ashamed of your frutes, because of the great wrath of the Lorde.
Jer.12.14	Thus sayeth the Lorde vpon all myne euell neyghbours, that laye hande on myne herytage, whych I haue possessed, euen my people of Israell. Beholde, I wyll plucke them (namely Israel) out of their lande, and put out the house of Iuda from among them.
Jer.12.15	And when I haue roted them out, I wylbe at one with them agayne, Ꟶ I wyll haue mercy vpon them: Ꟶ brynge them agayne, euery man to his awne herytage, and into his lande.
Jer.12.16	And yf they (namely that trouble my people) wyll lerne the wayes of them, to sweare by my name. The Lord lyueth (lyke as they learned my people to sweare by Baal) then shal they be rekened among my people.
Jer.12.17	But yf they wyll not obeye, then wyll I rote out the same folke, Ꟶ destroye them, sayth the Lord.
Jer.13.1	Thus sayth the Lord vnto me: go thy waye, Ꟶ get me a lynnen breche, Ꟶ gyrde it aboute thy loynes, Ꟶ let it not be wet.
Jer.13.2	Then I got me a breche, accordynge to the commaundement of the Lorde, and put it aboute my loynes.
Jer.13.3	After this the seconde tyme, the Lorde spake vnto me agayne.
Jer.13.4	Take the breche that thou hast prepared Ꟶ put about the, Ꟶ get the vp, Ꟶ go vnto Euphrates Ꟶ hyde it in a hole of the rock.
Jer.13.5	So went I, Ꟶ hydd it at Euphrates, as the Lord commaunded me.
Jer.13.6	And it happened longe after this, that the Lorde spake vnto me. Up, Ꟶ get the to Euphrates, and fet the breche from thence, which I commaunded the to hyde there.
Jer.13.7	Then went I to Euphrates, Ꟶ dygged vp, Ꟶ toke the breche from the place where I had hyd it: Ꟶ beholde, the breche was corrupt, so that it was profitable for nothynge.
Jer.13.8	Then sayde the Lorde vnto me.
Jer.13.9	Thus sayeth the Lorde. Euen so wyll I corrupte the pryde of Iuda, Ꟶ the hye mynde of Ierusalem.
Jer.13.10	This people is a wicked people, they wyll not heare my worde, they folowe the wicked ymaginacyons of their awne herte, Ꟶ hange vpon straunge Goddes, them they serue Ꟶ worshyppe: Ꟶ therfore they shalbe as this breche, that serueth for nothynge.
Jer.13.11	For as straytely as a breche lyeth vpon a mans loynes, so straytely dyd I bynde the whole house of Israel, and the whole house of Iuda vnto me, sayeth the Lorde: that they myght be my people: that they myght haue a glorious name: that they myght be in honour: but thei wold not obeye me.
Jer.13.12	Therfore laye this rydle before them, Ꟶ saye: Thus sayeth the Lorde God of Israell: Euery pot shalbe fylled wt wyne. And they shal saye: thynckest thou we knowe not, that euery pot shalbe fylled wt wyne?
Jer.13.13	Then shalt thou saye vnto them. Thus sayeth the Lord: Behold, I shall fyll all the inhabitours of thys lande wt dronckennes, the kynges that syt vpon Dauids stole, the prestes Ꟶ prophetes, wt all that dwell at Ierusalem.
Jer.13.14	And I wyll sett them one agaynst another, ye, the fathers agaynst the sonnes, sayeth the Lorde. I wyll not pardon them, I wyll not spare them, ner haue pytie vpon them: but destroye them.
Jer.13.15	Be obedient, geue eare, take not disdayne at it, for it is the Lord him selfe that speaketh.
Jer.13.16	Honoure the Lord your God here in, or he take hys lyght from you, Ꟶ or euer youre fete stomble in darcknesse at the hyll: lest when ye loke for the lyght, he turne it into the shadowe Ꟶ darcknesse of death,
Jer.13.17	But yf ye wyll not heare me, that geue you secrete warnyng, I wyll mourne from my whole hert for youre stubburnes. Pyteously wyll I wepe, Ꟶ the teares shall gusshe out of myne eyes. For the Lordes flocke shall be caryed awaye captyue.
Jer.13.18	Tell the kynge Ꟶ the quene: Humble youre selues, sett you downe lowe, for your dignytye shall be throwne downe Ꟶ the crowne of your glory shall fall from youre head.
Jer.13.19	The cyties towarde the south shalbe shut vp, Ꟶ no man shall open them. All Iuda shallbe caryed awaye captyue, so that none shall remayne.
Jer.13.20	Lyft vp your eyes, Ꟶ beholde them that come from the North wher is the flocke (o thou lande) that was gyuen the. And wher are thy fatt Ꟶ ryche sheape.
Jer.13.21	To whom wylt thou make thy mone, when the ennemy shall come vpon the? for thou hast taught them thy selfe, Ꟶ made them masters ouer the. Shall not sorowe come vpon the, as on a woman trauayllyng wt child?
Jer.13.22	And yf thou woldest saye them in thyne herte. Wherfore come these thynges vpon me? Euen for the multytude of thy blasphemyes, shal thy hynder partes Ꟶ thy fete be discouered.
Jer.13.23	For lyke as the man of Iude maye chaunge his skynne, Ꟶ the cat of the mountayne her spottes: so maye ye that be excercysed in euell, do good.
Jer.13.24	Therfore wyll I scatre them, lyke as the stoble that is taken awaye wyth the south wynde.
Jer.13.25	Thys shall be youre porcion, Ꟶ the porcion of your measure, wherwith ye shalbe rewarded of me, sayeth the lorde: because ye haue forgotten me, Ꟶ put youre trust in dysceatfull thynges.
Jer.13.26	Therfore shall I turne thy clothes ouer thy heade, Ꟶ discouer thy thyghes, that thy preuyties maye be sene,
Jer.13.27	thy aduoutry, thy deedly malyce, thy beastlinesse, Ꟶ thy shamefull whordome. For vpon the feldes and hylles I haue sene thy abhominacyons. Wo be vnto the (o Ierusalem) when wylt thou euer be clensed eny more?
Jer.14.1	The worde of the Lorde shewed vnto Ieremy, concernynge the derth of the frutes.
Jer.14.2	Iuda hath mourned, his gates are desolate: they are broughte to heuynesse euen vnto the grounde, Ꟶ the crye of Ierusalem goeth vp.
Jer.14.3	The lordes sent theyr seruauntes to fetch water, Ꟶ when they came to the welles, they dyd fynde no water, but caried their vessels home emptie. They be ashamed Ꟶ confounded, Ꟶ couer theyr heades.
Jer.14.4	For the grounde is dryed vp, because there commeth no rayne vpon it. The plowmen also be ashamed, Ꟶ couer theyr heades.
Jer.14.5	The Hynde also forsoke the yonge fawne, that he brought forth in the felde, because there was no grasse.
Jer.14.6	The wylde Asses dyd stande in the hye places, and drewe in theyr wynde lyke the dragons, theyr eyes dyd fayle for want of grasse.
Jer.14.7	Doutles oure awne wyckednes doth rewarde vs. But lorde do thou accordyng to thy name, though oure transgressyons Ꟶ synnes be many, and agenst the haue we synned.
Jer.14.8	For thou art the comfort Ꟶ helpe of Israel in the tyme of trouble. Why wilt thou be as a straunger in the lande, Ꟶ as one that goeth ouer the felde, Ꟶ commeth in only to remayne for a nyght?
Jer.14.9	Why wilt thou make thy selfe a cowarde, Ꟶ as it were a gyaunt that yet maye not helpe? For thou (O Lorde) art in the myddest of vs, Ꟶ thy name is called vpon of vs: forsake vs not.
Jer.14.10	Thus hath the Lord sayd vnto this people: seyng they haue had suche a lust to wander abrode, Ꟶ haue not refrayned theyr fete, Ꟶ therfore displeased the Lord: but he wyll now bringe agayne to remembraunce all their mysdedes, Ꟶ ponyshe all theyr synnes.
Jer.14.11	Yee, euen thus sayde the Lorde vnto me: Thou shalt not praye to do thys people good.
Jer.14.12	For though they fast, I wil not heare their praiers and though thei offre burntoffringes Ꟶ sacrifyces, yet wyll not I accepte them. For I will destroye them with the sweard, honger Ꟶ pestilence.
Jer.14.13	Then answered I: O Lorde God, the prophetes saye vnto them: Tush, ye shall nede to feare no sweard Ꟶ no honger shall come vpon you, but the Lorde shall geue you contynuall rest in this place.
Jer.14.14	And the Lorde sayde vnto me: The prophetes preach lyes in my name, where as I haue not sent them, nether gaue I them eny charge, nether dyd I speake vnto them: yet they preach vnto you false visions, charming, vanite, Ꟶ disceatfulnes of their awne herte.
Jer.14.15	Therfore, thus sayeth the Lord. As for those prophetes that preach in my name (whom I neuerthelesse haue not sent) Ꟶ that saye: Tush, there shall no swerde ner honger be in this land. With swearde Ꟶ with honger shall those prophetes perysh,
Jer.14.16	Ꟶ the people to whom they preache shalbe cast out of Ierusalem, dye of honger, Ꟶ be slayne wt the swearde, (Ꟶ there shalbe no man to burye them) both they Ꟶ theyr wyues, theyr sonnes and theyr daughters. For thus wyll I poure theyr wyckednesse vpon them.
Jer.14.17	Thys shalt thou say also vnto them. Myne eyes shall wepe without ceassynge daye Ꟶ nyght. For my people shalbe destroyed wt greate harme, Ꟶ shall perysh with a greate plage.
Jer.14.18	For yf I go into the felde, lo, it lyeth all full of slayne men. If I come into the cytie, lo, they be all famyshed of honger. Yee, theyr prophetes also Ꟶ prestes shalbe led into an vnknowne lande.
Jer.14.19	Hast thou then vtterly forsaken Iuda? Dost thou so abhorre Syon? Or hast thou so plaged vs, that we can be healed nomore? We loked for peace, and there commeth no good: for the tyme of health, and lo, here is nothing but trouble.
Jer.14.20	We knowledge (o Lorde) all our mysdedes, Ꟶ the synnes of our fathers, that we haue offended the.
Jer.14.21	Be not displeased, (O Lorde) for thy names sake, forget not thy louing kyndnesse. Remembre the throne of thyne honoure, breake not the couenaunt, that thou hast made wt vs.
Jer.14.22	Are there eny amonge the goddes of the Gentyles, that sende rayne or geue the showers of heauen? Or may the heuens drope rayne without thy commaundement? Dost not thou it, O Lorde our God, in whom we trust? Yee Lorde, thou dost all these thynges.
Jer.15.1	Then spake the Lord vnto me: Thoughe Moses Ꟶ Samuell stode before me, yet haue I no hearte to thys people. Driue them awaye, that they maye go out of my syght.
Jer.15.2	And yf they say vnto the. Whyther shall we go? Then tell them: The lord gyueth you thys answere. Some vnto death, some the swearde, some to honger, some into captyuyte.
Jer.15.3	For I will bryng foure plages vpon them, sayeth the Lorde. The swearde shall sleye them, the dogges shall teare them in peaces, the foules of the ayre, Ꟶ beastes of the earth shall eate them vp, and destroye them.
Jer.15.4	I wyll scatter them aboute also in all kyngdomes and landes to be plaged because of Manasseh the sonne of Hezekia kynge of Iuda, for the thynges that he dyd in Ierusalem.
Jer.15.5	Who shall then haue pyte vpon the, O Ierusalem? Who shall be sory for the? Or who shall make intercession, to optayne peace for the?
Jer.15.6	seynge thou goest fro me, Ꟶ turnest backwarde, sayeth the Lorde? Therfore, I dyd stretch out myne hande agaynst the, to destroye the, Ꟶ I haue bene sorye for the so longe that I am werye.
Jer.15.7	I haue scatred them abrode wt the fanne on ouery syde of the land. I haue wasted my people Ꟶ destroyed them. Yet they haue had no lust to turne from theyr awne wayes
Jer.15.8	I haue made theyr wyddowes mo in nombre, then the sandes of the see. Upon the mothers of their chyldren dyd I brynge a destroyer in the none daye. Sodenly and vnawarres dyd I sende a feare vpon theyr cyties.
Jer.15.9	She that hath borne seuen chyldren, hath noone, her herte is full of sorowe. The Sunne doth fayle her in the cleare daye, she is confounded and fayntie for very heuynesse. As for those that remayne, I wyll delyuer them vnto the swearde before theyr enemyes, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.15.10	O mother, alas that euer thou dydest beare me, a brawler Ꟶ rebuker of the whole lande: Thoughe I neuer lente ner receaued vpon vsury, yet all men speake euell vpon me.
Jer.15.11	And the Lorde answered me: Uerely thy remnaunte shall haue welthe. Come not I to the, when thou art in trouble: and helpe the, when thyne enemy oppresseth the?
Jer.15.12	Doth one yron hurte another or one metall that commeth from the North, another?
Jer.15.13	As for thy richesse and treasure, I wyll geue them out into a praye, not for eny money, but because of all thy synnes, that thou hast done in all thy coastes.
Jer.15.14	And I wyll brynge the with thyne enemyes into a land, that thou knowest not: for the fyre that is kyndled in my indignacyon, shall burne you vp.
Jer.15.15	O Lord, thou knowest: therfore remembre me, Ꟶ vyset me, delyuer me fro my persecuters. Take me not from this lyfe in the tyme of the longe pacyence, thou knowest, that for thy sake I suffer rebuke.
Jer.15.16	When I had founde thy wordes, I dyd eate them vp gredely: they haue made my herte ioyfull Ꟶ glad. For thy name was called vpon me, O Lorde God of Hostes.
Jer.15.17	I dwell not amonge the scorners, nether is my delyte therin: but I dwell only in the feare of thy hand, for thou hast fylled me with bytternes.
Jer.15.18	Shall my heuynes endure for euer? Are my plages then so greate, that they maye neuer be healed? Wilt thou be as one that is false Ꟶ as a water, that falleth, and cannot continue?
Jer.15.19	Upon these wordes, thus sayde the Lorde vnto me. If thou wilt turne agayne, I shall sett the in my seruice: and yf thou wilt take out the thynges that is precious from the vile, thou shalt be euen as myne awne mouth. They shall conuerte vnto the, but turne not thou vnto them:
Jer.15.20	Ꟶ so shall I make the a stronge brasen wall agaynst this people. They shall fight agaynst the, but they shall not preuayle. For I my selfe will be wt the, to helpe the, and deliuer the, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.15.21	And I wyll ryd the out of the handes of the wicked, and delyuer the out of the hande of tirauntes.
Jer.16.1	Thus sayde the Lord vnto me.
Jer.16.2	Thou shalt take the no wyfe, ner beget chyldren in this place,
Jer.16.3	For of the chyldren that are borne in this place, of theyr mothers that haue borne them, and of their fathers that haue begotten them in this lande thus sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.16.4	They shall dye an horrible deeth, no man shall mourne for them ner bury them, but they shall lye as donge vpon the earth. They shall perishe thorow the swearde and honger, and theyr bodyes shall be meate for the foules of the ayre, and beastes of the earth.
Jer.16.5	For thus saieth the Lorde: Go not thou in vnto them ner come to mourne and wepe for them: for I haue taken my peace from thys people (sayeth the Lorde) yee my fauoure Ꟶ my mercy.
Jer.16.6	And in this lande shall they dye, olde and yonge, and shall not be buried: no man shall bewepe them, no man shall clyppe or shaue him selfe for them.
Jer.16.7	There shal not one viset another, to mourne wyth them for their deed, or to comforte them. One shal not offre another the cuppe of consolacyon, to forget theyr heuynes for father and mother.
Jer.16.8	Thou shalt not go into theyr feast house, to syt downe, to eate or drincke with them.
Jer.16.9	For thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes the God of Israell: Beholde, I shall take awaye out of this place, the voyce of myrth and gladnesse, the voyce of the brydegrome and of the bryde: yee, and that in youre dayes, that ye maye se it.
Jer.16.10	Now when thou shewest this people all these wordes, Ꟶ they saye vnto the. Wherfore hath the Lorde deuysed all thys greate plage for vs? Or what is the offence Ꟶ synne, that we haue done agaynst the Lorde our God?
Jer.16.11	Then make thou them this answere: Because youre fathers haue forsaken me (sayeth the Lorde) and haue walked after straunge goddes, whom they haue honoured and worshypped: but me haue they forsaken, and haue not kepte my lawe.
Jer.16.12	And ye with your shamefull blasphemyes, haue exceaded the wyckednes of youre fathers. For euery one of you hath folowed the frowarde and euell ymaginacion of his awne herte, and is not obedient vnto me.
Jer.16.13	Therfore wyll I cast you oute of thys lande, into a lande that ye and youre fathers knowe not: and there shall ye serue straunge goddes daye and nyght, there wyll I shewe you no fauoure.
Jer.16.14	Beholde therfore (sayeth the Lorde) the dayes are come, that it shall nomore be sayde: The Lorde lyueth, which brought the children of Israel out of the lande of Egypte:
Jer.16.15	but, it shall be sayde, the Lorde lyueth, that brought the children of Israell from the North, and from all landes where he had scatred them. For I wyl brynge them agayne into the lande, that I gaue vnto theyr fathers.
Jer.16.16	Beholde (sayeth the Lorde) I wyl sende out many fyshers to take them, and after that wyll I sende out many hunters to hunte them out, from all mountaynes and hylles and out of the caues of stone.
Jer.16.17	For myne eyes beholde al theyr wayes, and they cannot be hyd fro my face, nether can theyr wycked dedes be kepte close out of my syghte.
Jer.16.18	But first wyll I sufficiently rewarde their shamefull blasphemies and synnes, because they haue defyled my lande: Namely with theyr stincking Idols Ꟶ with the carayns of their abhominacions, wherwith they haue filled myne herytage.
Jer.16.19	O Lorde, my strength, my power, and refuge in tyme of trouble. The Gentyles shall come vnto the from the endes of the worlde, and saye: Uerely our fathers haue cleaued vnto lyes, their Idols are but vayne Ꟶ vnprofitable.
Jer.16.20	How can a man make those his goddes, whyche are not able to be goddes?
Jer.16.21	And therfore I will once teach them, sayeth the Lorde, I wyll shewe them my hande Ꟶ my power, that they maye knowe, that my name is the Lorde.
Jer.17.1	Youre synne (O ye of the trybe of Iuda) is written in the table of your hertes, and grauen so vpon the edges of your aulters with a penne of yron and wyth an adamant clawe:
Jer.17.2	that as the fathers thyncke vpon their chyldren so thincke you also vpon your aulters, woddes, thicke trees, hye hylles, mountaynes Ꟶ feldes.
Jer.17.3	Wherfore, I wil make my mounte that standeth in the felde all your substaunce Ꟶ treasure be spoyled, for the great synne that ye haue done vpon youre hye places thorowe out all the coostes of youre lande.
Jer.17.4	Ye shall be cast out also from the heritage, that I gaue you. And I wil subdue you vnder the heuy bondage of your enemies, in a lande that ye knowe not. For ye haue ministred fyre to my indignacion, which shal burne euermore.
Jer.17.5	Thus sayth the Lord. Cursed be the man that putteth his trust in man, and that taketh fleshe for his arme: and he, whose herte departeth from the Lorde:
Jer.17.6	He shall be lyke the heath, that groweth in the wyldernes. As for the good thyng that is for to come, he shall not se it: but dwel in a drye place of the wyldernes, in a salt and vnoccupyed lande.
Jer.17.7	O blessed is the man, that putteth his trust in the Lorde, and whose hope is the Lorde him selfe.
Jer.17.8	For he shalbe as a tre, that is planted by the water syde: whyche spredeth out the rote vnto moystnesse, whom the heate cannot harme, when it commeth, but his leaffe shalbe grene. And though there growe but lytle frute because of drouth, yet is he not carefull, but he neuer leaueth of to brynge forth frute.
Jer.17.9	Amonge all thynges, man hath the most disceatfull and stubberne herte. Who shall then knowe it?
Jer.17.10	Euen I the Lorde searche out the grounde of the herte, and trye the reynes, Ꟶ rewarde euery man accordynge to his wayes, and accordynge to the frute of his workes.
Jer.17.11	The partriche maketh a nest of egges, whych she layde not. He commeth by ryches, but not ryghteouslye. In the myddest of his lyfe must he leaue them behynde him, and at the last be founde a very foole.
Jer.17.12	But thou (O Lorde) whose trone is most glorious, excellent and of most antyquite, which dwellest in the place of our holy rest:
Jer.17.13	Thou art the comforte of Israell. All they that forsake the, shalbe confounded: al they that departe from the, shalbe wrytten in earth for they haue forsaken the Lorde the very condyte of the waters of lyfe.
Jer.17.14	Heale me, O Lorde, and I shall be whole: saue thou me, and I shalbe saued, for thou art my prayse.
Jer.17.15	Beholde, these men saye vnto me. Where is the worde of the Lorde (Lett it come now.)
Jer.17.16	Where as I neuertheles obediently folowed the as a shepherde, and haue not vncalled taken this office vpon me, this knowest thou well. My wordes also were ryght before the.
Jer.17.17	Be not now terrible vnto me, O Lorde for thou art he in whome I hope, when I am in parell.
Jer.17.18	Let my persecuters be confounded, but not me, let them be afrayed, and not me. Thou shalt bryng vpon them the tyme of theyr plage, and shalt destroye them ryght sore.
Jer.17.19	Thus hath the Lorde sayde vnto me: Go and stande vnder the gate, where thorowe the people and the kynges of Iuda go out and in, yee vnder all the gates of Ierusalem,
Jer.17.20	and saye vnto them. Heare the worde of the Lorde, ye kynges of Iuda, and all thou people of Iuda, and all ye cytesyns of Ierusalem, that go thorowe thys gate.
Jer.17.21	Thus the Lorde commaundeth. Take hede for youre lyues, that ye carye no burthen vpon you in the Sabboth, to brynge it thorowe the gates of Ierusalem:
Jer.17.22	ye shall beare no burthen also out of youre houses in the Sabboth. Ye shall do no laboure therin, but halowe the Sabboth, as I commaunded youre fathers.
Jer.17.23	Howbeit, they obeyed me not, nether herkened they vnto me: but were obstynate and stubburne, Ꟶ nether obeyed me: nor receaued my correccion.
Jer.17.24	Neuertheles, yf ye will heare me (sayeth the Lord) and beare no burthen into the cytie thorowe this gate vpon the Sabboth: Yf ye wyll halowe the Sabboth, so that ye do no worcke therin:
Jer.17.25	then shal there go thorowe the gates of thys cytye, kynges and prynces, that shall syt vpon the throne of Dauid: They shall be caryed vpon charettes, Ꟶ ryde vpon horses, both they and their prynces. Yee, whole Iuda Ꟶ all the cytesyns of Ierusalem shall goo here thorow, and this cytie shal euer be the more and more inhabited.
Jer.17.26	There shall come men also from the cyties of Iuda, from about Ierusalem, and from the lande of Beniamin, from the playne feldes, from the mountaynes Ꟶ from the wyldernes: which shall bringe burntofferynges, sacrifices, oblacions, and incense, and offre vp thanckesgeuyng in the house of the Lorde.
Jer.17.27	But yf ye wyll not be obedient vnto me, to halowe the Sabboth, so that ye will beare your burthens thorow the gates of Ierusalem vpon the Sabboth. Then shall I set fyre vpon the gates of Ierusalem, and it shall burne vp the houses of Ierusalem, and no man shall be able to quench it.
Jer.18.1	This is another communicacion, that God had with Ieremy, saying:
Jer.18.2	Aryse, and goo downe into the Potters house, and there shall I tell the more of my mynde.
Jer.18.3	Now when I cam to the Potters house, I founde hym makynge his worcke vpon a whele.
Jer.18.4	The vessell that the Potter made of claye, brake amonge his handes: So be beganne a new, and made another vessel accordynge to his mynde.
Jer.18.5	Then sayde the Lorde thus vnto me.
Jer.18.6	Maye not I do with you, as this Potter doth, O ye house of Israel, sayeth the Lorde? Beholde, ye house of Israel: ye are in my hande, euen as the claye in the Potters hande.
Jer.18.7	When I take in hande to rote out, to destroye, or to waste awaye eny people or kyngdom
Jer.18.8	yf that people (agaynst whom I haue thus deuysed) conuerte from theyr wyckednes: I repente of the plage, that I deuysed to brynge vpon them.
Jer.18.9	Agayne, when I take in hande, to buylde, or to plante a people or a kyngdom:
Jer.18.10	yf the same people do euell before me, and heare not my voyce: I repente of the good, that I deuise to do for them:
Jer.18.11	Speake now therfore vnto whole Iuda: and to them that dwell at Ierusalem. Thus sayeth the Lorde: Beholde, I am deuisyng a plage for you, and am takynge a thing in hande agaynst you. Therfore let euery man turne from his euell waye, take vpon you the thynge that is good, and do right.
Jer.18.12	But they sayde. Nomore of this we wyll folowe oure awne ymaginacions, and do euery man accordynge to the wylfulnesse of his awne mynde.
Jer.18.13	Therfore thus sayeth the Lorde. Aske amonge the Heathen, yf eny man hath herde soch horryble thynges, as the daughter of Sion hath done.
Jer.18.14	Shall not the snowe (that melteth vpon the stony rockes of Libanus) moysten the feldes? Or maye the sprynges of waters be so grauen awaye, that they runne nomore, geue moystnesse, ner make frutefull?
Jer.18.15	But my people hath so forgotten me, that they haue made sacryfyce vnto vayne Goddes. And theyr prophetes make them fal in theyr wayes from the auncyent pathes, and to go into a fote waye not vsed to be troden of iust men.
Jer.18.16	Where thorowe they haue brought their lande into an euerlastyng wildernesse Ꟶ scorne. So that whosoeuer trauayleth therby, shalbe abashed, Ꟶ wagge theyr heades.
Jer.18.17	With an East wynde wyll I scatre them, before their enemie. And when their destruccion commeth, I wyll turne my backe vpon them, but not my face.
Jer.18.18	Then sayde they come, let vs ymagen somthynge agaynst this Ieremye. For the prestes shall not be destitute of the lawe, nether shall the wysemen de destitute of councel, ner the prophetes destitute of the worde of God. Come, and let vs smyte him with the tong, and let vs marke all his wordes.
Jer.18.19	Consydre me, O Lord, and heare the voyce of myne enemies
Jer.18.20	shall they recompence euell for good? for they haue digged a pit for my soule. Remembre, howe that I stode before the, to speake good for them, Ꟶ to turne awaye thy wrath from them.
Jer.18.21	Therfore let their children dye of hunger, and let them be oppressed wyth the swearde. Let their wiues be robbed of their children, and become wyddowes: let their husbandes be slayne, let their yonge men be kylled with the swearde in the felde.
Jer.18.22	Lett the noyse be herde out of their houses, when the murtherer commeth sodenly vpon them. For they haue dygged a pyt to take me, Ꟶ layed snares for my fete.
Jer.18.23	Yet Lorde, thou knowest all their councell, that they haue deuised, to slaye me. Forgeue not their wyckednes, and let not their sinne be put out of thy syght: but let them be iudged before the as the gyltie: This shalt thou do vnto them in the tyme of thy indignacion.
Jer.19.1	Thus sayde the Lorde: Go thy waye and bye the an earthen pytcher, and bryng forth the Senatours and chefe prestes
Jer.19.2	into the valley of the chyldren of Hennom, which lieth before the dore that is made of brycke, and shewe them there the wordes, that I shall tell the,
Jer.19.3	and saye thus vnto them. Heare the worde of the Lorde, ye kynges of Iuda, and ye cytesyns of Ierusalem. Thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes the God of Israell: Beholde I wyll bring soche a plage vpon this place, that the eares of all that heare it shal glowe.
Jer.19.4	And that because they haue forsaken me, and vnhalowed this place, Ꟶ haue offred in it vnto straunge goddes: whome nether they, theyr fathers, ner the kynges of Iuda haue knowne. They haue fylled thys place also with the bloude of innocentes
Jer.19.5	for they haue sett vp an aulter vnto Baal, to burne their children for a burntoffering vnto Baal, which I nether commaunded, ner charged them, nether thought once there vpon.
Jer.19.6	Beholde therfore the tyme commeth (sayeth the Lorde) that this place shall nomore be called Topheth, ner the valley of the chyldren of Hennom, but the valley of slaughter:
Jer.19.7	For in this place will I slaye the Senatours of Iuda Ꟶ Ierusalem, and kyll them downe with the swearde in the syght of theyr enemies, and of them that seke their lyues. And their deed carcases will I geue to be meate for the foules of the ayre, and beastes of the felde.
Jer.19.8	And I will make this citie so desolate and despysed: that who so goeth ther by, shall be abashed and ieast vpon her, because of all her plages.
Jer.19.9	I wyll fede them also with the flesh of their sonnes and their daughters. Yee, euery one shall eate vp another in the besegynge and straytnesse, wherwith their enemyes (that seke their lyues) shal kepe them in.
Jer.19.10	And the pitcher shalt thou breake in the sight of the men, that shalbe with the, Ꟶ saye vnto the:
Jer.19.11	Thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes: Euen so wyll I destroye this people and cytie: as a man breaketh an earthen vessell, that cannot be made whole agayne. In Topheth shal they be buried, for they shall haue none other place.
Jer.19.12	Thus wyl I do vnto this place also, sayeth the Lord, and to them that dwel therin: yee, I wil do to this citie as vnto Topheth
Jer.19.13	(For the houses of Ierusalem and the houses of the kynges of Iuda shalbe defyled, lyke as Topheth) because of all the houses, in whose parlers they dyd sacryfyce vnto all the hooste of heauen and powred drinke offeringes vnto straunge goddes.
Jer.19.14	And so Ieremy cam from Topheth, where the Lorde had sent him to prophecie, and stode in the court of the house of the Lorde, and spake to all the people:
Jer.19.15	Thus saieth the Lorde of Hostes the God of Israel: Beholde, I wyl brynge vpon this citie and vpon euery towne aboute it, all the plages that I haue deuised against them: for they haue bene obstinate, and wolde not obeye my warnynges.
Jer.20.1	When Phashur the preste, the sonne of Emer, chefe in the house of the Lorde, herde Ieremy preache so stedfastly:
Jer.20.2	he smote Ieremy Ꟶ put him in the stockes, that are by the hye gate of Ben Iamin, in the house of the Lorde.
Jer.20.3	The nexte daye folowynge Phashur brought Ieremy out of the stockes agayne. Then sayd Ieremy vnto him. The Lorde shall call the nomore Phashur (that is excellent and increasynge) but Magor (that is fearfull Ꟶ afrayed) euery where.
Jer.20.4	For thus sayeth the Lorde: beholde, I wyll make the afrayed, euen thy selfe, Ꟶ all that fauoure the: which shall perish with the swearde of their enemies, euen before thy face. And I wyll geue whole Iuda vnder the power of the kynge of Babylon, which shal carye some vnto Babylon presoners, Ꟶ slaye some with the swearde.
Jer.20.5	Moreouer, al the substaunce of this lande, all their precious and gorgeous worckes, all costlynes, and all the treasure of the kynges of Iuda: wyl I geue into the handes of their enemies, which shall spoyle them, and carie them vnto Babilon.
Jer.20.6	But as for the (O Phashur) thou shalt be caried vnto Babilon with all thine housholde, Ꟶ to Babylon shalt thou come, where thou shalt dye, and be buried: thou and al thy fauourers, to whom thou hast preached lyes.
Jer.20.7	O Lorde, Yf I am disceaued, then hast thou disceaued me: thou hast dealt strongly, and hast preuayled, and makest me stronge agayne. All the daye longe am I despised, Ꟶ laughed to scorne of euery man:
Jer.20.8	because I haue now preached longe agaynst malycious Tyranny, and shewed them of destruccion. For the whyche cause they cast the word of the Lorde in my teeth, and take me euer to the worst.
Jer.20.9	Wherfore, I thought from hence forth, not to speake of him, ner to preache eny more in his name. But the worde of the Lorde was a very burnynge fyre in my hert and in my bones, whiche when I wolde haue stopped, I myght not.
Jer.20.10	For why I herde so many derisions and blasphemies on euery syde of me: complayne vpon him, saye they, and we will tell his tale, yee euen of myne awne companions, and soch as were conuersant with me: went about to murther me, saying vpon him, we shall one waye or other begyle him and preuayle agaynst him, and be auenged of hym.
Jer.20.11	But the Lord stode by me, lyke a myghtie giaunt: therfore my persecutours fell, Ꟶ coulde do nothing. They shalbe sore confounded, for they haue done vnwysely, they shal haue an euerlastinge shame.
Jer.20.12	And now, O Lorde of Hostes, thou ryghteous searcher (which knowest the reynes and the very hertes:) let me se them punished, for vnto the I commytte my cause.
Jer.20.13	Synge vnto the Lorde, and prayse him, for he hath deliuered the soule of the oppressed, from the hande of the violent.
Jer.20.14	Cursed be the daye, wherin I was borne, vnhappie be the daye, wherin my mother brought me forth.
Jer.20.15	Cursed be the man, that brought my father the tydinges to make him glad, saying: thou hast gotten a sonne.
Jer.20.16	Let it happen vnto that man, as to the cyties which the Lord turned vp syde downe. Lett him heare cryenge in the mornynge, and at none daye lamentable howlynge.
Jer.20.17	Why slewest thou not me, as sone as I cam out of my mothers wombe? O that my mother had bene my graue her self, that the byrth myghte not haue come out, but remayned styll in her.
Jer.20.18	Wherfore cam I forth of my mothers wombe? To haue experience of laboure and sorowe? and to lead my lyfe with shame?
Jer.21.1	These are the wordes that the Lorde spake vnto Ieremy what tyme as kyng zedekiah sent vnto him Phashur the sonne of Melchias, and Sophonias the sonne of Maasias preste, sayinge.
Jer.21.2	Aske councell at the Lorde (we praye the) of our behalfe, for Nabuchodonosor the kynge of Babilon besegeth vs, yf the Lorde (peraduenture) will deale with vs, accordynge to his maruelous power, Ꟶ take him from vs.
Jer.21.3	Then spake Ieremy. Geue zedekias this answere.
Jer.21.4	Thus sayeth the Lorde God of Israel: beholde, I wil turne backe the weapens that ye haue in youre handes, wherwith ye fyght agaynst the kynge of Babylon Ꟶ the Caldees, which besege you round aboute the walles, and I will bringe them together into the myddest of this cytie,
Jer.21.5	Ꟶ I my selfe wyll fyght against you, with an outstretched hande, Ꟶ with a myghtie arme, in great displeasure and terrible wrath:
Jer.21.6	Ꟶ wyll smyte them, that dwel in this citie: yee, both men and catell shall dye of a great pestilence.
Jer.21.7	And after this (sayeth the Lorde) I shal deliuer zedekias the kinge of Iuda, and his seruauntes, his people (and soch as are escaped in the citie, from the pestilence, swearde and honger) into the power of Nabuchodonosor kynge of Babylon: yee, into the handes of theyr enemyes, into the handes of those that folowe vpon their lyues, which shall smyte them with the swearde, they shal not pytie them, they shall not spare them, they shall haue no mercy vpon them.
Jer.21.8	And vnto this people thou shalt saye. Thus sayeth the Lorde: beholde, I laye before you the waye of lyfe Ꟶ deeth.
Jer.21.9	Who so abydeth in this cytie, shall perish: ether with the swearde, wyth honger, or wyth pestilence. But who so goeth out to holde on the Chaldees parte, that besege it, he shall saue hys lyfe Ꟶ shall wynne his soule for a pray.
Jer.21.10	For I haue set my face agaynst this cytie (sayeth the Lorde) to plage it, and to do it no good. It must be geuen into the hande of the king of Babylon, and be brent with fyre.
Jer.21.11	And vnto the house of the kyng of Iuda, saye thus: Heare the worde of the Lord
Jer.21.12	(O thou house of Dauid) for thus saith the Lord: Minister ryghteousnes, and that soone, delyuer the oppressed from violent power or euer my terryble wrath breake out lyke a fyre, and burne so, that no man maye quench it, because of the wyckednes of youre ymaginacions.
Jer.21.13	Beholde (sayeth the Lorde) I will come vpon you, that dwell in the valleyes, rockes and feldes, and saye. Tush: who will make vs afrayed? or who will come into oure houses?
Jer.21.14	For I wyll vyset you (saieth the Lorde) because of the wickednes of your inuencions, and wyll kyndle soche a fyre in youre wood, as shall consume al that is aboute you.
Jer.22.1	Thus sayde the Lorde, Go downe into the house of the kynge of Iuda, Ꟶ speake there these wordes,
Jer.22.2	and saye: Heare the worde of the Lorde, thou king of Iuda that syttest in the kyngly seat of Dauid: thou and thy seruauntes and thy people that go in and out at this gate.
Jer.22.3	Thus the Lorde commaundeth: kepe equyte and righteousnesse, deliuer the oppressed from the power of the violent: do not greue ner oppresse the straunger, the fatherlesse ner the wyddow. and shed no innocent bloude in this place.
Jer.22.4	And yf ye kepe these thynges faythfully then shal there come in at the dore of this house kinges, to sit vpon Dauids seate: they shalbe caried in Charettes and ryde vpon horses both they and their seruauntes, and theyr people.
Jer.22.5	But yf ye will not be obedient vnto these commaundementes, I sweare by myne awne selfe (sayeth the Lorde) thys house shal be waste.
Jer.22.6	For thus hath the Lorde spoken vpon the kynges house of Iuda. Thou Gilead art vnto me the head of Libanus. Shall I not make the so waste (Ꟶ thy cyties also) that no man shall dwell therin?
Jer.22.7	I wil prepare a destroyer with his weapens for the, to hewe downe thy speciall Cedre trees, and to cast them in the fyre.
Jer.22.8	And all the people that go by this cytie, shal speak one to another. Wherfore hath the Lorde done thus vnto this noble cytie?
Jer.22.9	Then shall it be answered: because they haue broken the couenaunt of the Lorde theyr God, and haue worshypped Ꟶ serued straunge goddes.
Jer.22.10	Mourne not ouer the deed, and be not wo for them, but be sory for hym that departeth awaye: for he commeth not agayne, and seeth his natiue countre no more.
Jer.22.11	For thus sayeth the Lorde, as touchynge Selum the sonne of Iosias kynge of Iuda, which raygned after his father, and is caried out of this place, he shal neuer come hyther agayne,
Jer.22.12	for he shal dye in the place, wher vnto he is led captiue, and shall se this lande nomore.
Jer.22.13	Wo worth him, that buyldeth hys house with vnrighteousnes, and his parlers with the good that he hath gotten by vyolence: which neuer recompenseth his neyghbours laboure, ner payeth him his hyre.
Jer.22.14	He thyncketh in him selfe. I wyll buylde me a wyde house, Ꟶ gorgeous parlers. He causeth windowes to be hewen therin, and the sylynges and ioystes maketh he of Cedre, and paynteth them with Synaper.
Jer.22.15	Thynckest thou to raygne, now that thou prouokest me to wrath with the Cedre trees? Dyd not thy father eate and drincke, and prospere well, as longe as he dealt wt equite and righteousnesse?
Jer.22.16	Yee, when he helped the oppressed and poore to their right, then prospered he well. From whence came thys, but onely because he had me before hys eyes, sayeth the Lorde?
Jer.22.17	Neuertheles, as for thyne eyes and thyne herte, they loke vpon coueteousnesse, to shed innocent bloude, to do wronge Ꟶ violence.
Jer.22.18	And therfore, thus sayeth the Lorde agaynst Iehoakim, the sonne of Iosias kyng of Iuda. They shall not mourne for him (as they vse to do) alas brother, alas syster. Nether shal they saye vnto him: Alas syr, alas for that noble prince.
Jer.22.19	But as an Asse shall he be buryed, corrupte and be cast without the gates of Ierusalem.
Jer.22.20	Clyme vp the hyll of Libanus (O thou daughter Sion) lyft vp thy voyce vpon Basan, crye from all partes: for all thy louers are destroyed.
Jer.22.21	I gaue the warnynge, whyle thou wast yet in prosperyte. But thou saydest: I wyll not heare. And this maner hast thou vsed from thy youth, that thou woldest neuer heare my voyce.
Jer.22.22	All thy herdmen shalbe driuen with the wynde, and thy derlynges shalbe caryed awaye into captiuite. Then shalt thou be brought to shame Ꟶ confusion because of al thy wickednes:
Jer.22.23	thou that dwellest vpon Libanus, Ꟶ makest thy nest in the Cedre trees O how litle shalt thou be regarded when thy sorowes Ꟶ pangues come vpon the, as a woman trauelynge with chylde.
Jer.22.24	As truly as I lyue (sayeth the Lorde:) Though Conanias the sonne of Iehoakim kynge of Iuda were the sygnet of my right hande, yet will I plucke him of.
Jer.22.25	And I will geue the into the power of them that seke to slaye the, and into the power of them that thou fearest: into the power of Nabuchodonosor the Kynge of Babylon, and into the power of the Caldees.
Jer.22.26	Moreouer, I wyll sende the, and thy mother that bare the into a straunge lande, where ye were not borne, and there shall ye dye.
Jer.22.27	But as for the lande that ye wyll desyre to returne vnto, ye shal neuer come at it agayne.
Jer.22.28	This man Conanias shall be lyke an ymage robbed Ꟶ torne in peces, which pleaseth noman, for all hys apparell. Wherfore both he and his sede shalbe sent awaye, and cast out into a lande, that they knowe not.
Jer.22.29	O thou earth, earth, earth: heare the worde of the Lorde. Thus sayeth the Lorde:
Jer.22.30	Wryte this man amonge the outlawes, for no prosperite shall this man haue all his lyfe longe. Nether shall eny of his sede be so happie, as to syt vpon the seat of Dauid, and to beare rule in Iuda.
Jer.23.1	Wo be vnto the shepherdes, that destroye, and scatre my flocke, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.23.2	Wherfore this is the commaundement of the Lorde God of Israel, vnto the shepeherdes that fede my people: Ye scatre Ꟶ thrust out my flocke, Ꟶ loke not vpon them. Therfore now wyll I vyset the wickednes of youre ymagynacions, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.23.3	And wyll gather together the remnaunt of my flocke, from all landes that I had dryuen them vnto, and will brynge them agayne to their pastures, that they maye growe and increase.
Jer.23.4	I wyll set shepherdes also ouer them, which shall fede them. They shall nomore feare and drede, for there shall none of them be lost, saieth the Lorde.
Jer.23.5	Beholde, the tyme commeth, sayeth the Lorde, that I wyll rayse vp the ryghteous braunche of Dauid, which kynge shall beare rule, and he shall prosper with wysedome, Ꟶ shall set vp equite Ꟶ righteousnes agayne in the erth.
Jer.23.6	In this tyme shall Iuda be saued, and Israell shall dwell without feare. And this is the name that they shal call him: euen the Lorde oure ryghteousnesse.
Jer.23.7	And therfore beholde, the tyme commeth, sayeth the Lorde that it shall nomore be sayde: the Lorde lyueth, which brought the chyldren of Israell out of the lande of Egypte:
Jer.23.8	But the Lorde lyueth, which brought forth, and led the sede of the house of Israel, out of the North lande, and from all countrees where I had scatred them, and they shall dwell in their awne lande agayne.
Jer.23.9	My herte breaketh in my body because of the false prophetes, al my bones shake: I am become lyke a droncken man (that by the reason of wyne can take no rest) for verye feare of the Lorde, and of his holy wordes:
Jer.23.10	Because the lande is full of aduouterers Ꟶ thorowe swering it mourneth Ꟶ the pleasaunt pastures of the deserte are dryed vp. Yee, the waye that men take, is wicked, and theyr gouernaunce is nothinge lyke the holy worde of the Lorde.
Jer.23.11	For prophetes and the prestes them selues are polluted ypocrites, and theyr wyckednes haue I founde in my house, saieth the Lorde.
Jer.23.12	Wherfore, their way shall be slyppery in the darcknesse, where in they maye stacker Ꟶ fall. For I wyll bryng a plage vpon them, euen the yeare of theyr visitacion saieth the Lorde.
Jer.23.13	I haue sene foly amonge the Prophetes of Samaria, that they preached for Baall, and disceaued my people of Israell.
Jer.23.14	I haue sene also amonge the Prophetes of Ierusalem foule aduoutry, and presumpteous lyes. They take the most shamefull men by the hande, flattringe them, so that they cannot returne from theyr wyckednes. All these wt their cytesyns are vnto me, as Sodome, and as the inhabitours of Gomorre.
Jer.23.15	Therfore thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes concernynge the prophetes: Beholde, I will fede them with wormwod, and make them drincke the water of gall. For from the prophetes of Ierusalem is ypocrisye come into all the lande.
Jer.23.16	And therfore the Lorde of Hostes geueth you this warninge. Heare not the wordes of the prophetes, that preach vnto you, and disceaue you: surely they teache you vanyte for they speake the meanynge of their awne herte, Ꟶ not out of the mouth of the Lorde.
Jer.23.17	They saye vnto them that despyse me: The Lorde hath spoken it: Tush: ye shal prospere ryght well. And vnto all them, that walcke after the lust of theyr awne hert, they saye: Tush, there shall no misfortune happen you.
Jer.23.18	For who hath sytten in the councell of the Lorde, that he hath herde Ꟶ vnderstande, what he is aboute to do: Who hath marcked hys deuyce, and herde it?
Jer.23.19	Beholde, the stormy wether of the Lorde (that is, his indignacion) shall go forth, and a vyolent whirlwynde shall fal downe vpon the heade of the vngodly.
Jer.23.20	And the wrath of the Lorde shall not turne agayne, vntyll he perfourme and fulfyl the thought of hys herte. And in the latter dayes ye shall knowe his meanynge.
Jer.23.21	I haue not sent these prophetes (saieth the Lorde) Ꟶ yet they ranne. I haue not spoken to them, and yet they preached.
Jer.23.22	But yf they had continued in my councell they had opened to my people my wordes Ꟶ they had turned my people from their euell wayes Ꟶ wycked ymagynacions.
Jer.23.23	Am I then God that seyth but the thinge, whiche is nye at hande, and not that is farre of? sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.23.24	Maye eny man hyde hym self so, that I shall not se hym? sayeth the Lorde. Do not I fulfyll heauen and earth? sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.23.25	I haue herde well ynough, what the prophetes saye that preache lyes in my name, sayeng: I haue dreamed, I haue dreamed.
Jer.23.26	How longe wyll this continue in the prophetes hert to tell lyes, and to preache the crafty sotylte of their awne hert?
Jer.23.27	Whose purpose is (with the dreames that euery one tell) to make my people forget my name, as theyr forefathers dyd, when Baall came vp.
Jer.23.28	The prophet that hath a dreame let hym tell it and he that vnderstandeth my worde, let hym shewe it faythfully. For what hath chaffe and wheate to do together? sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.23.29	Is not my worde lyke a fyre, sayeth the Lorde, and Lyke an hammer, that breaketh the harde stone.
Jer.23.30	Therfore thus sayeth the Lorde: beholde, I wyll vpon the prophetes, that steale my worde priuely from euery man:
Jer.23.31	Beholde, here am I (sayeth the Lorde) agaynst the prophetes, that make tunges tender to speake, Ꟶ saye: The Lorde hath sayde it.
Jer.23.32	Beholde, here am I (sayeth the Lorde) agaynst those prophetes, that darre prophecy lyenge dreames, and disceaue my people with their vanyties, and myracles, whom I neuer sent, ner commaunded them. They shall do this people greate harme, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.23.33	Yf this people, ether eny prophet or preste aske the and saye: what is the burthen of the Lorde? Thou shalt saye vnto them: what burthen? Therfore wyll I cast you fro me, (sayeth the Lorde) because ye your selues a
Jer.23.34	And the prophet, preste or people that vseth this terme (the burthen of the Lorde) hym wyll I viset, and his house also.
Jer.23.35	But thus shall ye saye, euery one to another, Ꟶ euery man to his brother. What answere hath the Lord geuen? or what is the Lordes commaundement?
Jer.23.36	And as for the burthen of the Lorde, ye shal speake nomore of it: for euery mans awne worde is his burthen because ye haue altered the wordes of the lyuynge God the Lorde of Hostes our God.
Jer.23.37	Thus shall euery man saye to the Prophetes: what answere hath the Lorde geuen the? Or, what sayth the Lorde?
Jer.23.38	And not once to name the burthen of the Lorde. Therfore thus saieth the Lorde. For so moche as ye haue vsed thys terme (the burthen of the Lorde) where as I notwithstandynge sent vnto you, and forbade you to speake of the Lordes burthen.
Jer.23.39	Beholde therfore, I wyll repute you as a burthen, and will cast you out of my presence: yee, and the citie also, that I gaue you and your fathers:
Jer.23.40	and will bryng you to an euerlastinge confusion, and into soch a shame, as shall neuer be forgotten.
Jer.24.1	The Lorde shewed me a vysion: Beholde, there stode two maundes of fygges before the temple of the Lorde, after that Nabuchodonosor kynge of Babylon had led awaye captiue Iechonias the sonne of Iehoakim kynge of Iuda the myghtie men also of Iuda, with the worckmasters, and connynge men of Ierusalem, vnto Babilon.
Jer.24.2	In the one maunde were very good fygges, euen lyke as those that be first ripe. In the other maunde were very naughty fygges, which might not be eaten, they were so euell.
Jer.24.3	Then sayde the Lorde vnto me: what seyst thou Ieremy? I sayde fygges, wherof some be very good, and some so euel, that no man maye eate them.
Jer.24.4	Then came the worde of the Lorde vnto me, after this maner:
Jer.24.5	Thus saieth the Lorde the God of Israell: lyke as thou knowest the good figges, so shall I knowe the men led awaye, whom I haue sent out of this place into the lande of the Caldees, for theyr profyte:
Jer.24.6	and I will set myne eyes vpon them for the best, for I wyll brynge them agayne into this lande: I wyll buylde them vp, and not breake them downe: I will plante them, and not rote them out.
Jer.24.7	And I wyll geue them an herte, to knowe how that I am the Lorde. They shalbe my people, Ꟶ I will be their God, for they shall returne vnto me with their whole herte.
Jer.24.8	And lyke as thou knowest the naughtie figges, which maye not be eaten, they are so euell: Euen so wyll I (sayeth the Lorde) let zedekias the Kynge of Iuda, (ye and all his princes, Ꟶ the residue of Ierusalem that remayne ouer in thys lande, and them also that dwell in Egipte) to be vexed and plaged in all kyngdomes and landes.
Jer.24.9	And wyll make them to be a reprofe, a comen by worde, a laughynge stocke and shame, in all the places, where I shall scatre them.
Jer.24.10	I wil sende the swearde, honger Ꟶ pestilence amonge them, vntyll I haue cleane consumed them out of the lande, that I gaue vnto them and theyr fathers.
Jer.25.1	A sermon that was geuen vnto Ieremy, vpon all the people of Iuda. In the fourth yeare of Iehoakim the sonne of Iosias kynge of Iuda that was in the fyrst yeare of Nabuchodonosor kyng of Babilon.
Jer.25.2	Which sermon, Ieremy the prophet made vnto all the people of Iuda, and to all the inhabitours of Ierusalem, on this maner.
Jer.25.3	From the thyrtene yeare of Iosias the sonne of Amon kynge of Iuda, vnto thys present daye (that is euen .xxiii. yeare) the worde of the Lorde hath bene committed vnto me. And so I haue spoken to you, I haue rysen vp early, I haue geuen you warnynge in season, but ye wolde not heare me.
Jer.25.4	Though the Lorde hath sent hys seruauntes, all the prophetes vnto you in season. Yet wolde ye not obeye, ye wolde not enclyne youre eares to heare.
Jer.25.5	He sayde turne agayne euery man from his euell waye, and from your wicked ymaginacions, and so shall ye dwell for euer in the lande, that the Lorde promised you Ꟶ youre forefathers.
Jer.25.6	And go not after straunge goddes, serue them not, worship them not, and angre me not wyth the worckes of your handes: then wyl not I punish you.
Jer.25.7	Neuertheles ye wolde not heare me (sayth the Lord:) but haue defied me with the worckes of your handes, to your awne greate harme.
Jer.25.8	Wherfore thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes: Because ye haue not herkened vnto my worde,
Jer.25.9	lo, I wyll sende out, Ꟶ call for all the people, that dwell in the North, sayeth the Lorde, and will prepayre Nabuchodonosor the kynge of Babylon my seruaunt, and will brynge them vpon this lande, and vpon all that dwell therin, and vpon all the people that are aboute them, and wyll vtterly rote them oute. I will make of them a wildernesse, a mockage, and a continuall deserte.
Jer.25.10	Moreouer, I wyll take from them the voyce of gladnesse and solace, the voyce of the brydegrome and the bryde, the voyce of the anoynted, with the creshettes:
Jer.25.11	and thys whole lande shall become a wyldernes, and these nacions shall serue the kynge of Babylon, threscore yeares and ten.
Jer.25.12	When the .lxx. yeares are expired, I wyll vyset also the wyckednesse of the kynge of Babylon and his people sayeth the Lorde: yee, and the lande of the Caldees, and wyll make it a perpetuall wyldernes,
Jer.25.13	and wyll fulfyll all my wordes vpon that lande, which I haue deuised agaynst it: yee, all that is written in this boke, which Ieremy hathe prophecyed of all people:
Jer.25.14	so that they also shall be subdued vnto diuers nacions Ꟶ great kynges for I wyll recompense them, accordynge to theyr dedes and worckes of theyr awne handes.
Jer.25.15	For thus hath the Lorde God of Israel spoken vnto me: Take this wyne cuppe of indignacion fro my hande, that thou mayest cause all the people, to whom I send the, for to dryncke of it:
Jer.25.16	that when they haue droncken therof, they maye be mad, Ꟶ out of their wyttes, when the swearde commeth, that I wyll sende amonge them.
Jer.25.17	Then toke I the cuppe from the Lordes hande, and made all people to dryncke therof, vnto whome the Lorde had sent me.
Jer.25.18	But fyrst the cytie of Ierusalem, Ꟶ all the cyties of Iuda, their kynges and prynces, to make them desolate, wast, despysed, and hyssed at, and cursed, accordynge as it is come to passe this daye.
Jer.25.19	Yee, and Pharao the kinge of Egypte, his seruauntes, his princes and his people all together one wyth anoth
Jer.25.20	Ꟶ all kynges of the lande of Hus, all kynges of the Philistines lande, Ascalon, Azah, Accaron and the remnaunt of Asdod,
Jer.25.21	the Edomites, the Moabites and the Ammonites
Jer.25.22	al the kynges of Tirus Ꟶ Sidon: the kinges of the Iles that are beyonde the see:
Jer.25.23	Dedan, Thema, Buz Ꟶ all them that dwell in the vttermost partes of the worlde:
Jer.25.24	all the kinges of Araby and (generally) all the kynges that dwel in the deserte:
Jer.25.25	al the kinges of zamri, al the kynges of Elam, all the kinges of the Medees,
Jer.25.26	all kynges towarde the North, whether they be farre or nye, euery one agaynst his neyghbours: Yee, and all the kyngdomes that are vpon the whole earth. The kynge of Sezach sayde he shall dryncke with them also.
Jer.25.27	Therfore saye thou vnto them: Thys is the commaundement of the Lorde of Hostes the God of Israel: Drincke and be droncken, spewe and fall, that ye neuer ryse, and that thorowe the swearde, whych I wyll sende amonge you.
Jer.25.28	But yf they will not receaue the cuppe of thy hande, and dryncke it, then tell them: Thus doth the Lorde of Hostes threaten you: dryncke it ye shall, and that shortely.
Jer.25.29	For lo, I begynne to plage the cytye, that my name is geuen vnto: thincke ye then that I wyll leaue you vnpunished? Ye shal not go quyte, for why, I call for a swearde vpon all the inhabitours of the earth, sayeth the Lorde of Hostes.
Jer.25.30	Therfore tell them all these wordes and saye vnto them. The Lorde shall crye from aboue, and let his voyce be herde from hys holy habytacion. With a great noyse shall he crye from hys courte regall. He shall geue a great voyce, lyke the grape gatherers, and the sounde ther of shalbe hearde vnto the endes of the worlde.
Jer.25.31	For the Lorde hath a iudgement to geue vpon all people, Ꟶ will holde his court of iustice with all flesh, and punish the vngodly, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.25.32	For thus sayth the Lord of hostes: Beholde, a miserable plage shall goo from one people to another, and a greate stormy water shall aryse from all the endes of the earth.
Jer.25.33	And the same daye shall the Lorde him selfe sleye them, from one ende of the earth to another. There shall no mone be made for eny of them, none gathered vp, none buryed: but shall lye as dunge vpon the grounde.
Jer.25.34	Mourne, O ye shepherdes, and crye: sprinkle youre selues with ashes, O ye rammes of the flocke: for the tyme of youre slaughter is fulfylled, that ye shall sleye one another, and you shalbe scatred, and ye shall fall lyke vessels connyngly made.
Jer.25.35	The shepherdes shall haue no waye to fle, and the rammes of the flocke shall not escape.
Jer.25.36	Then shall the shepherdes crye horryly, and the rammes of the flocke shall mourne? for the Lorde hath consumed their pasture,
Jer.25.37	and theyr best feldes lye deed because of the horryble wrath of the Lord.
Jer.25.38	They haue forsaken theyr foldes lyke as a lyon. For theyr lande is waste, because of his furiouse crueltye, and of his fearfull indignatyon.
Jer.26.1	In the begynninge of the raygne of Iehoakim the sonne of Iosiah kyng of Iuda, came thys worde from the Lorde, sayinge:
Jer.26.2	Thus sayeth the Lorde: Stande in the court of the Lordes house, and speake vnto all them which (oute of the cyties of Iuda) come to do worshyp in the Lordes house, all the wordes that I commaunde the to saye. Loke that thou kepe not one worde backe,
Jer.26.3	yf peraduenture they wyll herken, and turne euery man from hys wycked waye: that I maye also repente of the plage, which I haue determyned to brynge vpon them, because of theyr wicked inuencyons.
Jer.26.4	And after thys maner shalt thou speake vnto them: Thus sayth the Lorde: yf ye will not obey me, to walke in my lawes, which I haue geuen you,
Jer.26.5	and to heare the wordes of my seruauntes the prophetes, whom I sent vnto you, rysynge vp tymely, and styll sendynge. If ye wyll not folowe them (I saye)
Jer.26.6	then I wyll do to thys house as I dyd vnto Siloh, and wyll make thys citye to be abhorred of all the people of the earth.
Jer.26.7	And the preastes, the prophetes and all the people hearde Ieremy preache these wordes, in the house of the Lorde.
Jer.26.8	Nowe when he had spoken out all the wordes that the Lorde commaunded him to preach vnto the people, then the prestes, the prophetes and all the people toke holde vpon him, and sayde: thou shalt dye.
Jer.26.9	Howe darest thou be so bolde, as to saye in the name of the Lorde, it shall happen to thys house as it dyd vnto Siloh: and thys citye shalbe so waste, that no man shall dwell therin?
Jer.26.10	And when all the people were gathered about Ieremy in the house of the Lorde, the princes of Iuda hearde of this rumour, and they came soone oute of the kynges palace, into the house of the Lord: and sat them downe before the newe dore of the Lorde.
Jer.26.11	Then spake the prestes and the prophetes vnto the rulers and to all the people, these wordes: Thys man is worthy to dye, for he hath preached agaynst thys citye, as ye youre selues haue hearde with your eares.
Jer.26.12	Then sayde Ieremy vnto the rulers and to all the people: The Lorde hath sent me to preache agaynst this house and agaynst this cytie all the wordes that ye haue heard.
Jer.26.13	Therfore amende youre wayes, and youre aduysementes, and be obedient vnto the voyce of the Lorde youre God: so shall the Lorde repente of the plage, that he hath deuised agaynst you.
Jer.26.14	Nowe as for me: I am in your handes, do with me, as ye thynke expedient and good.
Jer.26.15	But this shall ye knowe: yf ye put me to death, ye shall make youre selues, thys citye and all the inhabytours therof, gyltye of innocent bloude. For thys is of a trueth that the Lorde hath sent me vnto you, to speake all these wordes in youre eares.
Jer.26.16	Then sayde the rulers and the people vnto the prestes and prophetes: This man maye not be condempned to death, for he hath preached vnto vs in the name of the Lorde oure God.
Jer.26.17	The elders also of the lande stode vp, and saide thus vnto all the people:
Jer.26.18	Micheah the Morasthite, which was a prophet vnder Ezekiah kynge of Iuda, spake to all the people of Iuda. Thus sayeth the Lorde of hostes: Syon shalbe plowed lyke a felde, Ierusalem shalbe an heape of stones, and the hyll of the Lordes house shalbe turned to an hye wod.
Jer.26.19	Dyd Ezekiah the kynge of Iuda, and the people of Iuda put hym to death for this? No verely: but rather feared the Lord, and made theyr prayer vnto hym. For the which cause also the Lorde repented of the plage, that he had deuysed agaynst them. Shulde we then do soch a shamefull dede agaynst oure soules?
Jer.26.20	There was a prophete also, that preached styfly in the name of the Lorde, called Uriah the sonne of Semeiah of Cariathiarim: this man preached also agaynst this citye and agaynst this lande, according to all as Ieremy sayth.
Jer.26.21	Nowe when Iehoakim the kinge with all the estates Ꟶ prynces had hearde hys wordes, the kynge went about to slaye hym. When Uriah perceaued that, he was afrayed, and fledd, and departed into Egipte.
Jer.26.22	Then Iehoakim the kinge sent seruauntes into the lande of Egypt, namely Elnathan the sonne of Achbor, and certayne men with hym into Egipt,
Jer.26.23	which fetched Uriah out of Egipt, and brought him vnto kynge Iehoakim, that slewe him with the sweard, and cast hys deed bodye into the comen peoples graue.
Jer.26.24	But Ahikam the sonne of Saphan helped Ieremye, that he came not into the handes of the people to be slayne.
Jer.27.1	In the begynninge of the reygne of Iehoakim the sonne of Iosiah kyng of Iuda, came this word vnto Ieremy from the Lorde, which spake thus vnto me:
Jer.27.2	Make the bondes and chaynes, and put them about thy necke,
Jer.27.3	and send them to the kynge of Edom, to the kynge of Moab, to the kynge of Ammon, to the king of Tirus, and to the kynge of Sidon: and that by the messengers, which shall come to Ierusalem vnto zedekiah the kinge of Iuda:
Jer.27.4	and byd them saye vnto theyr masters: Thus sayth the Lorde of hostes the God of Israel: speake thus vnto your masters:
Jer.27.5	I am he that made the earth, the men and the catell that are vpon the grounde, with my great power and outstretched arme, and haue geuen it vnto whom it pleased me.
Jer.27.6	And now will I delyuer all these landes into the power of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon my seruaunt. The beastes also of the felde shall I geue hym to do hym seruyce.
Jer.27.7	And all people shall serue hym, Ꟶ hys sonne, and his childers children, vntill the tyme of the same lande become also: yee, many people and great kinges shall serue him.
Jer.27.8	Moreouer, that people and kyngdome, which wyll not serue Nabuchodonosor, and that wyll not putt theyr neckes vnder the yocke of the kyng of Babilon: the same people wyll I vyset with the swearde, with honger, with pestilence, vntyll I haue consumed them in hys handes, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.27.9	And therfore, folowe not your prophetes, sothesayers, expounders of dreames, charmers and wytches: which saye vnto you: ye shall not serue the kynge of Babylon.
Jer.27.10	For they preache you lyes: to brynge you farre from your lande, and that I might cast you out, and destroye you.
Jer.27.11	But the people that put theyr neckes vnder the yock of the king of Babylon, and serue hym, those I will let remayne styll in their awne lande, sayth the Lorde, and they shall occupye it, and dwell therin.
Jer.27.12	All these thynges tolde I zedekiah the king of Iuda, and sayde: Put your neckes vnder the yocke of the king of Babilon, and serue him and his people, that ye maye lyue.
Jer.27.13	Why wylt thou and thy people perysh with the swearde, with honger, with pestylence: lyke as the Lorde hath deuysed for all people, that wyll not serue the kynge of Babylon?
Jer.27.14	Therfore, geue no eare vnto those prophetes, that tell you: ye shall not serue the kyng of Babylon: for they preache you lies:
Jer.27.15	nether haue I sente them, sayeth the Lorde. Howbeit they are bolde, falsely to prophecy in my name: that I myght the sooner dryue you out, and that ye myght peryshe with yor preachers.
Jer.27.16	I spake to the prestes also, and to all the people. Thus sayth the Lorde: Heare not the wordes of those prophetes, that preache vnto you, and saye: Beholde, the vesselles of the Lordes house shall shortlye be brought hyther agayne from Babilon. For they prophecye lyes vnto you.
Jer.27.17	Heare them not, but serue the kynge of Babylon, that ye maye lyue. Wherfore wyll ye make thys citye to be destroyed?
Jer.27.18	But yf they be true prophetes in very dede, and yf the worde of the Lorde be committed vnto them, then let them praye the Lorde of hostes, that the remnaunt of the ornamentes (which are in the house of the Lorde, and remayne yet in the house of the kynge of Iuda and at Ierusalem) be not caryed to Babylon also.
Jer.27.19	For thus hath the Lorde of hoostes spoken concernynge the pyllers, the lauer, the seate and the resydue of the ornamentes that yet remayne in thys citye,
Jer.27.20	which Nabuchodonosor the kynge of Babylon toke not, when he caryed awaye Iechoniah the sonne of Iehoakim king of Iuda with all the power of Iuda and Ierusalem, from Ierusalem vnto Babylon, captyue.
Jer.27.21	Yee, thus hath the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel spoken, as touchynge the resydue of the ornamentes of the Lordes house, of the kynge of Iudaes house, and of Ierusalem.
Jer.27.22	And thys was done in the same yeare, euen in the begynnynge of the raygne of zedekiah kynge of Iuda.
Jer.28.2	But in the .iiij. yeare of the raygne of zedekiah kinge of Iuda, in the .v. moneth, it happened that Hananiah the sonne of Assur the prophet of Gibeon, spake to me in the house of the Lorde, in the presence of the prestes, Ꟶ of all the people, and sayde:
Jer.28.3	Thus sayth the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel: I haue broken the yock of the king of Babilon,
Jer.28.4	Ꟶ after two yeare will I brynge agayne into this place: all the ornamentes of the Lordes house, that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon caried awaye from this place vnto Babilon.
Jer.28.5	Yee, I wyll bringe agayne Iechoniah the sonne of Iehoakim the kinge of Iuda hym selfe, with all the presoners of Iuda (that ar caryed vnto Babilon) euen into thys place, sayth the Lorde: for I wyll breake the yock of the kinge of Babylon.
Jer.28.6	Then the prophet Ieremy gaue answere vnto the prophet Hananiah, before the prestes and before all the people that were present in the house of the Lord.
Jer.28.7	And the prophete Ieremy sayde: Amen, the Lorde do that, and graunte the thyng which thou hast prophecyed: that he maye bryng agayne all the ornamentes of the Lordes house, and restore all the presoners from Babylon into this place.
Jer.28.8	Neuerthelesse, herken thou also, what I wyll saye, that thou and all the people maye heare.
Jer.28.9	The prophetes that were before vs in tyme past, which prophecyed of warre, or trouble, or pestilence,
Jer.28.10	ether of peace, vpon many nacyons and great kingdomes, were proued by thys (yf God had sende them in very dede) when the thynge came to passe, which that prophete tolde before.
Jer.28.11	And Hananiah the prophet toke the chayne from the prophete Ieremyes necke, and brake it,
Jer.28.12	and with that sayde Hananiah, that all the people might heare. Thus hath the Lorde spoken: Euen so will I breake the yock of Nabuchodonosor king of Babilon, from the neck of all nacions: yee, and that within this two yeare. And so the prophet Ieremye went his waye.
Jer.28.13	Nowe after that Hananiah the prophete had taken the chayne from the prophete Ieremyes necke, and broken it. The worde of the Lorde came vnto the prophete Ieremy, saieng:
Jer.28.14	Go, and tell Hananiah thes wordes. Thus sayth the Lorde. Thou hast broken the chayne of wodd: but in steade of wodd thou shalt make cheynes of yron.
Jer.28.15	For thus sayth the Lord of hostes the God of Israel: I wyll put a yock of yron vpon the neck of all this people, that they maye serue Nabuchodonosor the king of Babilon: yee, and so shall they do. And I wyll geue hym the beastes in the felde.
Jer.28.16	Then sayde the prophet Ieremy vnto the prophet Hananiah: heare me Hananiah: The Lorde hath not sent the but thou bringest this people into a false belefe.
Jer.28.17	And therfore thus sayth the Lorde: beholde, I wyll sende the out of the lande, and within a yeare thou shalt dye, because thou hast falsely spoken agaynst the Lorde.Ier
Jer.29.1	These are the wordes of the boke, that Ieremy the prophet sent from Ierusalem vnto the presoners, the senatoures, prestes, prophetes, Ꟶ all the people, whom Nabuchodonosor had led vnto Babilon:
Jer.29.2	after that time that king Iechoniah and his quene, his chamberlaynes, the princes of Iuda and Ierusalem, the worckemasters of Ierusalem were departed thyther.
Jer.29.3	Which boke Elasah the sonne of Saphan, and Gamariah the sonne of Helkiah dyd beare, whom zedekiah the kyng of Iuda sent vnto Babilon to Nabuchodonosor the kinge of Babilon: these were the wordes of Ieremyes boke.
Jer.29.4	Thus hath the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel spoken vnto all the presoners, that were led from Ierusalem vnto Babylon:
Jer.29.5	buylde you houses to dwel therin: plante you gardens, that ye maye enioye the frutes therof:
Jer.29.6	take you wyues, to beare you sonnes Ꟶ daughters, prouyde wyues for your sonnes and husbandes for your daughters that they maye get sonnes and daughters, and that ye maye multiplye there. Laboure not to be fewe,
Jer.29.7	but seke after peace and prosperite of the citye, wherin ye be presoners, Ꟶ praye vnto God for it. For in the peace therof, shall yor peace be.
Jer.29.8	For thus sayth the Lorde of hostes the God of Israel. Let not these prophetes and sothsayers that be among you disceaue you: Ꟶ beleue not your awne dreames.
Jer.29.9	For why? they preache you lyes in my name, and I haue not sent them, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.29.10	But thus sayth the Lorde. When ye haue fulfylled .lxx. yeares at Babylon, I wyll brynge you home, Ꟶ of myne awne goodnes I wyll carye you hyther agayne into thys place.
Jer.29.11	For I know what I haue deuised for you, sayth the Lorde. My thoughtes are to geue you peace, and not trouble (which I geue you all ready) and that ye myght haue hope againe.
Jer.29.12	Ye shall crye vnto me, ye shall go and call vpon me, and I shall heare you.
Jer.29.13	Ye shall seke me and fynde me. Yee, yf so be that ye seke me with your whole hert,
Jer.29.14	I wil be founde of you, sayth the Lorde, and wyll delyuer you oute of preson, and gather you together agayne out of all places, wherin I haue scatered you, sayeth the Lorde, and wyll brynge you agayne to the same place, from whence I caused you to be caried awaye captiue.
Jer.29.15	But where as ye saye, that God hath raised you vp prophetes at Babilon.
Jer.29.16	Thus hath the Lorde spoken to the kinge that sytteth in the throne of Dauid, and to all the people that dwell in this citye, youre brethren that are not gone with you into captiuytie.
Jer.29.17	Thus (I saye) speaketh the Lord of hostes: Beholde, I wyll sende a swearde, honger and pestilence vpon them, and wyll make them lyke vntimely fygges, that maye not be eaten for bitternes.
Jer.29.18	And I will persecute them with the swearde, with honger, and pestilence. I will delyuer them vp to be vexed of all kingdomes, to be cursed, abhorred, laughed to scorne, and put to confusyon of all the people, amonge whom I haue scatered them:
Jer.29.19	and that because they haue not bene obedient vnto my commaundementes, sayth the Lorde, which I sente vnto them by my seruauntes the prophetes. I stode vp early, and sent vnto them: but they wolde not heare, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.29.20	Heare therfore the worde of the Lorde, all ye presoners, whom I sente from Ierusalem vnto Babilon.
Jer.29.21	Thus hath the Lorde of hostes the God of Israel spoken of Ahab the sonne of Colaiah, and of zedekiah the sonne of Maasiah, which prophecye lyes vnto you in my name. Beholde, I wyll deliuer them into the hande of Nabuchodonosor the kyng of Babilon, that he maye slaye them before youre eyes.
Jer.29.22	And all the presoners of Iuda, that are in Babilon shall take vpon thys terme of cursynge, and saye: Nowe God do vnto the, as he dyd vnto zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babilon rosted in the fyer,
Jer.29.23	because they synned shamefully in Israel. For they haue not onely defiled their neyghbours wyues, but also preached lyinge wordes in my name, which I haue not commaunded them. This I testifye, and assure, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.29.24	But as for Semeiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speake vnto hym.
Jer.29.25	Thus sayth the Lord of hostes the God of Israel: Because thou hast sealed letters vnder thy name vnto all the people that is at Ierusalem, and to Sophoniah the sonne of Maasiah the preste: yee, Ꟶ sent them to all the prestes: wherein thou wrytest thus vnto hym:
Jer.29.26	The Lorde hath ordeyned the to be preste in the stead of Iehoiada the preste: that thou shuldest be the chefe in the house of the Lord aboue all prophetes, and preachers, and that thou mightest set them vpon the pillery, or in the stockes.
Jer.29.27	Howe happeneth it then, that thou hast not reproued Ieremye of Anathoth, which neuer leaueth of his prophecienge.
Jer.29.28	And besyde all thys, he hath sent vs worde vnto Babilon, and tolde vs playnely, that oure captiuite shall longe endure: that we shulde buylde vs houses to dwell therin: Ꟶ to plante vs gardens that we maye enioye the frutes therof.
Jer.29.29	Which lettre Sophoniah the preaste redde, and let Ieremy the prophete heare it.
Jer.29.30	Then came the worde of the Lorde vnto Ieremy, sayinge:
Jer.29.31	Sende worde to all them that be in captiuyte, on thys maner: Thus hath the Lorde spoken concerning Semeiah the Nehelamite: Because that Semeiah hath prophecyed vnto you without my commyssion, Ꟶ brought you into a fals hope,
Jer.29.32	therfore thus the Lorde dothe certifye you: Beholde, I will viset Semeiah the Nehelamite, and his seede: so that none of hys shall remayne amonge this people, and none of them shall se the good, that I will do for this people, sayth the Lorde. For he hath preached falsely of the Lorde.
Jer.30.1	These are the wordes, that the Lord shewethe vnto Ieremye, sayinge:
Jer.30.2	Thus sayth the Lorde God of Israel: Wryte vp diligently all the wordes, that I haue spoken vnto the, in a booke.
Jer.30.3	For lo, the tyme commeth, sayth the Lorde, that I wyll bryng agayne the presoners of my people of Israel and Iuda, sayth the Lord. For I wyll restore them vnto the lande, that I gaue to theyr fathers, Ꟶ they shall haue it in possession.
Jer.30.4	Agayne, these wordes spake the Lorde, concerning Israel and Iuda:
Jer.30.5	Thus sayth the Lorde: We haue hearde a terrible crye, feare and disquietnes.
Jer.30.6	For what elles do thys signifye, that I se? Namely, that all stronge men smyte, euery man hys hande vpon hys loynes, as a woman in the paine of her trauayle. Who euer sawe a man trauayle with childe? Enquyre therafter, and se. Yee, all their faces are maruelous pale.
Jer.30.7	Alas for this daye, which is so dredefull that none maye be likened vnto it: and alas for the tyme of Iacobs trouble, from the which he shall yet be delyuered.
Jer.30.8	For in that daye, sayth the Lorde, I will take his yocke from of thy neck, Ꟶ breake thy bondes: And strangers shall nomore serue hym:
Jer.30.9	but they shall do seruice vnto God theyr Lorde, and to Dauid theyr kynge, whom I wyll rayse vp vnto them.
Jer.30.10	And as for the, O my seruaunt Iacob, feare not, sayth the Lorde, and be not afraied, O Israel. For lo, I wyll helpe the also from farre, and thy seed from the lande of their captiuytie. And Iacob shall turne agayne, he shalbe in rest, and haue a prosperous lyfe, Ꟶ no man shall make him afrayed.
Jer.30.11	For I am with the to helpe the, sayth the Lorde. And though I shall destroie all the people, amonge whom I haue scatered the, yet wyll I not destroye the, but correcte the, and that with discretion. For I knowe that thou art in no wyse without faute.
Jer.30.12	Therfore thus sayth the Lord: Thy brosinges are peryllous, Ꟶ thy woundes ready to cast the in to sicknes.
Jer.30.13	Ther is no man to medle with thy cause, or to lay plaster vpon the, or to bynde vp thy woundes: there maye no man helpe the.
Jer.30.14	All thy louers haue forgotten the, and care nothynge for the. For I haue geuen the a cruell stroke, and chastened the roughly: and that for the multitude of thy mysdedes: for thy synnes haue had the ouer hande.
Jer.30.15	Why makest thou mone for thy harme? in dede, thou art sore wounded Ꟶ in ieopardye: but for the multitude of thy mysdedes and synnes, I haue done this vnto the.
Jer.30.16	And therfore, all they that deuoure the, shalbe deuoured: and all thyne enemies shalbe led into captiuite. All they that make the wast, shalbe wasted them selues, Ꟶ all those that robbe the, wyll I make also to be robbed.
Jer.30.17	For I wyll geue the thy health agayne and make thy woundes whole, sayeth the Lorde: because they reuyled the, as one cast awaye and despised, Syon (sayde they) is she whom no man regardeth.
Jer.30.18	For thus sayth the Lorde: Beholde, I will bring agayne the captiuytie of Iacobs tentes, and defende his dwelling place. The citye shalbe buylded in her olde estate, and the houses shall haue their ryght foundacion,
Jer.30.19	And out of them shall go thankesgeuing, and the voyce of ioye. I will multiplye them, and they shall not be fewe. I shall endue them with honoure, Ꟶ no man shall subdue them.
Jer.30.20	Theyr chyldren shalbe as a fore tyme, and their congregacion shall continue in my syght. And all those that vexe them, wyll I vyset.
Jer.30.21	A captayne also shall come of them: and a prynce shall springe out from the myddest of them: hym will I chalenge to my selfe, and he shall come vnto me. For what is he, that geueth ouer his hert to come vnto me? sayth the Lorde.
Jer.30.22	Ye shalbe my people also, and I wilbe youre God.
Jer.30.23	Beholde, on the other syde shall the wrath of the Lorde breake out as a stormy water as a mighty whirle winde: and shall fall vpon the heades of the vngodly.
Jer.30.24	The terrible displeasure of the Lorde shall not leaue of, vntyll he haue done, and perfourmed the intent of hys herte, which in the latter dayes ye shall vnderstande.
Jer.31.1	At the same tyme, sayth the Lord, shall I be the God of all the generatyons of Israel, and they shalbe my people.
Jer.31.2	Thus sayeth the Lorde: The people of Israel, which escaped in the wildernesse from the swearde, founde grace to come into theyr rest.
Jer.31.3	Euen so shall the Lorde now also apeare vnto me from farre, and saye: I loue the with an euerlasting loue, therfore, by my mercye I haue drawen the to me.
Jer.31.4	I will repayre the agayne, O thou daughter of Israel, that thou mayest be fast and sure. Thou shalt take thy tabrettes agayne, and go forth with them, that leade the daunce.
Jer.31.5	Thou shalt plante vynes agayne vpon the hylles of Samaria, and the grape gatherers shall plante, and commenly eate of it.
Jer.31.6	For the dayes shall come when the watchemen vpon the mount of Ephraim shall crye: aryse, let vs go vp vnto Sion to our Lorde God,
Jer.31.7	for thus sayth the Lorde: Reioyce with gladnes because of Iacob, crie vnto the head of the Gentils: speake out, syng, and saye: O Lorde saue thy people, the remnaunt of Israel, and make them whole.
Jer.31.8	Beholde, I wyll bringe them agayne from out of the north lande, and gather them from the endes of the worlde, with the blynde and lame that are amonge them, with the wemen that be great with chylde, and soch as be also delyuered: and the company of them that come agayne, shalbe greate.
Jer.31.9	They shall come weping and with mercyfull pitye wyll I bring them hyther agayn. I wyll leade them to the ryuers of water in a strayght waye, where they shall not stomble. For I am Israels father, Ꟶ Ephraim is my fyrst borne.
Jer.31.10	Heare the worde of the Lorde, O ye Gentiles, preach in the yles, that lye farre of, and saye: he that hath scatered Israel, shall gather hym together agayne, Ꟶ shall kepe hym as a shepherde doth his flocke.
Jer.31.11	For the Lord hath redemed Iacob, and ryd hym from the hande of the violent.
Jer.31.12	And they shall come, Ꟶ reioyce vpon the hyll of Sion, and shall haue plenteousnes of goodes, which the Lorde shall geue them. Namely, wheate, wyne, oyle, yonge shepe Ꟶ calues. And theyr conscience shalbe as a well watred garden, for they shall nomore be hongrye.
Jer.31.13	Then shall the mayde reioyce in the daunce, yee, both yonge and olde folkes. For I wyll turne their sorowe into gladnesse, and wyll conforte them from theyr sorowes and make them ioyfull.
Jer.31.14	I wyll powre plenteousnesse vpon the hertes of the prestes, and my people shalbe satisfyed with my goodnesse, sayth the Lord
Jer.31.15	Thus sayth the Lorde: The voyce of heuynes, weping and lamentation was heard on hye: euen of Rachel mournyng for her children, and wolde not be conforted, because they were awaye.
Jer.31.16	But nowe, sayth the Lorde, leaue of from wepynge and crienge, witholde thyne eyes from teares, for thy laboure shalbe rewarded, sayth the Lorde. And they shall come agayne out of the lande of their enemies:
Jer.31.17	Yee, euen thy posterite shall haue consolation in this, sayth the Lorde, that thy chyldren shall come agayne into their awne lande.
Jer.31.18	Moreouer, I heard Ephraim, that was led awaye captiue, complayne on this maner: O Lorde, thou hast correct me, Ꟶ thy chastenynge haue I receaued, as an vntamed calfe. Conuerte thou me, and I shalbe conuerted: for thou art my Lorde God:
Jer.31.19	Yee, assone as thou turnest me, I shall refourme my selfe: and when I vnderstande, I shall smyte vpon my thyghe. For verely I haue commytted shamefull thinges. For I haue borne the reprofe and confusion of my youth.
Jer.31.20	Upon this complaynte, I thought thus by my selfe: is not Ephraim my deare sonne? Is he not the childe, with whom I haue had all myrth and pastyme? For sens the time that I first commened with hym, I haue him euer in remembraunce: therfore, my very hert dryueth me vnto him, gladly and louynglye wyll I haue mercy vpon him, sayth the Lord.
Jer.31.21	Get the watchmen, prouyde teachers for the, set thyne hert vpon the ryght waye, that thou shuldest walke, and turne agayn, O thou daughter of Israel, turne agayne to these cityes of thyne.
Jer.31.22	Howe longe wilt thou go astraye, O thou shrynking daughter? For the Lord wyll worke a newe thing vpon earth. A woman shall compasse a man.
Jer.31.23	For thus sayth the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel: It wyll come therto, that when I haue brought Iuda out of captiuite, these wordes shalbe heard in the lande and in hys cityes. The Lorde, which is the fayre brydegrome of ryghteousnes, make the frutefull, O thou holy hyll.
Jer.31.24	And there shall dwell Iuda, and all her cityes, the shepherdes, and husbandemen.
Jer.31.25	For I shall fede the hongrye soule, and refresh all faynte hertes.
Jer.31.26	When I hearde thys, I came agayne to my selfe, I mused, lyke as I had bene waked oute of a swete slepe.
Jer.31.27	Beholde, sayth the Lorde, the dayes come, that I wyll sowe the house of Israel, Ꟶ the house of Iuda, with men and with catell.
Jer.31.28	Yee, it shall come therto, that lyke as I haue gone about in tymes past to rote them out, to scatre them, to breake them downe, to destroye them, and chasten them. Euen so wyll I also go diligently aboute, to buylde them vp agayne, Ꟶ to plante them, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.31.29	Then shall it nomore be sayde: the fathers haue eaten a sower grape, and the chyldrens teeth are set on edge:
Jer.31.30	for euery one shall dye for hys awne mysdede, so that whoso eateth a sowre grape, hys teeth shalbe set on edge.
Jer.31.31	Beholde, the dayes come, sayth the Lorde, that I wyll make a newe couenaunt wt the house of Israel, and wt the house of Iuda:
Jer.31.32	not after the couenaunt that I made wt their fathers, when I toke them by the hande: and led them out of the lande of Egypt: which couenaunt they bracke: yee, euen when I as an husbande had rule ouer them, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.31.33	But this shalbe the couenaunt that I wyll make with the house of Israel after those dayes, sayth the Lorde. I will plante my lawe in the inward partes of them, and wryte it in their hertes, Ꟶ wilbe their God, and they shalbe my people.
Jer.31.34	And from thens forth, shall no man teach his neyghbour or his brother, Ꟶ saye: knowe the Lorde. But they shall all knowe me from the lowest vnto the hyest, sayth the Lorde. For I will forgeue their mysdedes, and will neuer remembre their synnes eny more.
Jer.31.35	Thus sayth the Lorde, which gaue the sunne to be a lyght for the daye, and the moone and starres to shyne in the night: which moueth the see, so that the floudes therof waxe fearce: his name is the Lorde of hoostes.
Jer.31.36	Like as this ordinaunce shall neuer be taken oute of my syght, sayth the Lorde. So shall the sede of Israel neuer ceasse, but allwaye be a people before me.
Jer.31.37	Moreouer, thus sayth the Lorde: lyke as the heauen aboue cannot be measured, Ꟶ as the foundacions of the earth beneth maye not be sought out. So wyll I also not cast out the whole seede of Israel, for that they haue commytted, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.31.38	Beholde, the dayes come, sayth the Lord, that the citye of the Lorde shalbe enlarged from the towre of Hananeel, vnto the gate of the corner wall:
Jer.31.39	From thens shall the ryght measure be taken before her vnto the hyll toppe of Gareb, Ꟶ shal come about Gaath,
Jer.31.40	and the whole valley of the deed carkases, and of the ashes, and all the feldes vnto the broke of Cedron: and vnto the corner of the horsgate towarde the east, where as the sanctuary of the Lorde also shalbe set. And when it is nowe buylded, and set vp of thys fasshyon, it shall neuer be be broken, nor cast downe any more.
Jer.32.1	These wordes spake the Lorde vnto Ieremy, in the .x. yeare of zedekiah king of Iuda: which was the .xviij. yeare of Nabuchodonosor,
Jer.32.2	what tyme as the kyng of Babylons hoost layed seage vnto Ierusalem. But Ieremy the prophet laye bounde in the courte of the preson, which was in the king of Iudas house:
Jer.32.3	where zedekiah the kyng of Iuda caused hym to be layed, because he had prophecyed of this maner: Thus sayeth the Lorde: Beholde, I wyll delyuer this citye into the handes of the kyng of Babilon, which shall take it.
Jer.32.4	As for zedekiah the kynge of Iuda: he shall not be able to escape the Chaldees: but surely he shall come into the handes of the kyng of Babylon: which shall speake wt him mouth to mouth: and one of them shall loke another in the face.
Jer.32.5	And zedekiah shalbe caryed vnto Babylon, and there shall he be, vntyll the tyme that I viset hym, sayth the Lorde. But yf thou takest in hande to fyght agaynst the Chaldees, thou shalt not prospere.
Jer.32.6	And Ieremy sayde: thus hath the Lorde spoken vnto me:
Jer.32.7	Behold, Hananeel the sonne of Selum thyne vncles sonne, shall come vnto the, and requyre the to redeme the lande that lyeth in Anathoth vnto thy selfe: for by reason of kynred it is thy right to redeme it, and to bye it out.
Jer.32.8	And Hananeel myne vncles sonne came to me in the court of the preson, accordynge to the worde of the Lorde, and sayde vnto me: Bye my lande, I praye the, that lieth in Anathoth in the contrey of Beniamin: for by heritage thou haste ryght to loose it oute for thy selfe, therfore redeme it. Then I perceaued that thys was the commaundement of the Lorde,
Jer.32.9	and so I bought the lande from Hananeel of Anathoth, myne vncles sonne, and weied him there the moneye: euen seuen syckles and ten syluer pence.
Jer.32.10	I caused hym also to make me a writing and to seale it: and called recorde therby, and weyed hym there the money vpon the wayghtes.
Jer.32.11	So I toke the euidence with the copye, when it was orderlye sealed and redde ouer,
Jer.32.12	and I gaue the euidence vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah the sonne of Maasiah in the syght of Hananeel my cosyne, and in the presence of the witnesses, that be named in the euidence: and before all the Iewes that were therby in the courte of the preson:
Jer.32.13	I charged Baruch also before them sayinge:
Jer.32.14	The Lord of hostes the God of Israel commaundeth the, to take thys sealed euydence with the copie: and to laye it in an earthen vessell, that it maye longe continue.
Jer.32.15	For the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel hath determyned that houses, feldes, and vyneyardes shalbe possessed agayne in this lande.
Jer.32.16	Now when I had deliuered the euidence vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, I besought the Lorde, saying:
Jer.32.17	O Lord God, it is thou that hast made heauen and earth with thy greate power and hie arme, and there is nothyng hyd from the.
Jer.32.18	Thou shewest mercy vpon thousandes, thou recompencest the wickednes of the fathers, into the bosome of the children that come after them.
Jer.32.19	Thou art the greate and mightye God, whose name is the Lorde of hoostes: greate in councell, and excellent in worcke. Thyne eyes loke vpon all the wayes of mens chyldren, to reward euery one after his waye: Ꟶ according to the frutes of his inuencions.
Jer.32.20	Thou haste done greate tokens and wonders in the lande of Egypte, as we se thys daye, vpon the people of Israel and vpon those men: to make thy name greate, as it is come to passe thys daye.
Jer.32.21	Thou hast brought thy people of Israel oute of the land of Egipt, with tokens, with wonders, with a myghtye hande, with a stretched out arme and wt greate terriblenes:
Jer.32.22	and hast geuen them this lande, lyke as thou haddest promysed vnto their fathers. Namely, that thou woldest geue them a lande, that floweth with mylke and honye.
Jer.32.23	Nowe when they came therin, and possessed it, they folowed nott thy voyce, and walcked not in thy lawe, but all that thou commaundedest them to do, that haue they not done, and therfore come all these plages vpon them.
Jer.32.24	Beholde, there are bullworckes made now agaynst the citye, to take it: and it shalbe wonne of the Chaldees that besege it, with swearde, with honger and death, and looke what thou hast spoken, that same shall come vpon them. For lo, all thynges are present vnto the.
Jer.32.25	Yet (saist thou vnto me, O Lorde God) and commaundest me, that I shall loose a pece of lande vnto my selfe, and take witnesses therto: and yet in the meane season the citye is delyuered into the power of the Chaldees.
Jer.32.26	Then came the worde of the Lorde vnto me, sayinge:
Jer.32.27	Beholde, I am the Lorde God of all fleshe, is there eny thynge then to hard for me?
Jer.32.28	Therfore thus saith the Lorde: beholde, I shall delyuer thys citye into the power of the Chaldees, and into the power of Nabuchodonosor the kynge of Babylon, they shall take it in.
Jer.32.29	For the Chaldees shall come, and wynne thys citye, and sett fyer vpon it, and burne it: with the gorgeouse houses, in whose parlers they haue made sacrifyce vnto Baal, and powred drynckofferynges vnto straunge Goddes, to prouoke me vnto wrath.
Jer.32.30	For seyng the chyldren of Israel, and the children of Iuda haue wrought wickednes before me euer from theyr youth vp, what haue they els done, but prouoked me wt the workes of their awne handes? sayth the Lorde.
Jer.32.31	Or, what hath this citye bene elles but a prouoking of my wrath, euer sence the daye that they buylded it, vnto thys houre wherin I cast it out of my sight,
Jer.32.32	because of the great blasphemyes of the children of Israel Ꟶ Iuda, which they haue done to prouoke me: yee, they, their kynges, their prynces, their prestes, their prophetes, the men of Iuda, and the cytesyns of Ierusalem.
Jer.32.33	When I stode vp early, and taught them and instructed them, they turned their backes to me, and not theyr faces.
Jer.32.34	They wolde not heare, to be refourmed and correct: but set their ydols in the house, that is halowed vnto my name, to defyle it.
Jer.32.35	They haue builded hye places for Baal in the valley of the chyldren of Hennom, to vowe theyr sonnes and daughters vnto Moloch: which I neuer commaunded them: nether came it euer in my thoughte, to make Iuda synne with soch abhominatyon.
Jer.32.36	And nowe therfore, thus hath the Lorde God of Israel spoken, concernynge this cytie, which (as ye youre selues confesse) shalbe delyuered into the hande of the kynge of Babylon, when it is wonne with the swearde, with honger and with pestilence.
Jer.32.37	Beholde, I will gather them together from all landes, wherin I haue scatered them in my wrath in my fearfull and great displeasure: and wyll bring them agayne vnto thys place, where they shall dwell safely.
Jer.32.38	And they shalbe my people, and I wilbe their God.
Jer.32.39	And I wyll geue them one hert and one waye, that they maye feare me all the daies of their lyfe, that they and their chyldren after them maye prospere.
Jer.32.40	And I wyll sett vp an euerlastyng couenaunt with them. Namelye, that I wyll neuer ceasse to do them good, and that I wyll put my feare in their hertes, so that they shall not runne awaye from me.
Jer.32.41	Yee, I will haue a lust and pleasure to do them good, and faythfully to plante them in this lande with my whole hert and with all my soule.
Jer.32.42	For thus sayth the Lorde: lyke as I haue brought all this great plage vpon this people, euen so wyll I also bring vpon them all the good, that I haue promised them.
Jer.32.43	And men shall haue their possessions in this lande, wherof ye saye nowe, that it shall nether be inhabited of people ner of catell: but be deliuered into the handes of the Chaldees.
Jer.32.44	Yee, lande shalbe bought for money, Ꟶ euidences made therupon, and sealed before witnesses in the countrey of Beniamin, and rounde aboute Ierusalem, in the cities of Iuda, in the cities that are vpon the mountaynes, and in them that lye beneth: yee, and in the cityes that are in the south. For I wyll brynge their presoners hither agayne, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.33.1	Moreouer, the worde of the Lorde came vnto Ieremy on thys maner, when he was yet bound in the court of the preson.
Jer.33.2	Thus sayth the Lorde, which fulfilleth the thing that he speaketh: the Lorde which perfourmeth the thing that he taketh in hand: euen he, whose name is the Lorde:
Jer.33.3	crye vnto me, Ꟶ I wyll answere, and shewe the great and hye thinges, which were vnknowen vnto the.
Jer.33.4	Thus (I saye) spake the Lorde God of Israel, concerninge the houses of thys citye, and the houses of the kinges of Iuda, that they are broken thorowe the ordinaunce and the sweard.
Jer.33.5	Because the enhabitours of this citie haue come to fight against the Chaldees: and they are fylled with the deed karcases of men, whom I haue sleyne in my wrath and displeasure: when I turned my face from thys citye, because of all her wickednes.
Jer.33.6	Behold, sayth the Lord, I wyll repayre Ꟶ heale their woundes, and make them whole: I will open them the large treasure of peace and trueth.
Jer.33.7	And I will returne the captiuytie of Iuda and Israel: and wyll set them vp agayne as they were afore.
Jer.33.8	From all mysdedes, wherin they haue offended agenst me, I will clense them. And all their blasphemyes which they haue done agaynst me, when they regarded me not, I will forgeue them.
Jer.33.9	And thys shall get me a name, a prayse, Ꟶ honoure among all the people of the earth, which shall heare all the good, that I wyll shewe vnto them: yee, they shall be afrayed and astonyed at all the good dedes and benefytes that I wyll do for them.
Jer.33.10	Moreouer, thus sayth the Lorde: In this place, wherof ye saye that it shalbe a wyldernes, wherin nether people ner catell shall dwell: in like maner in the cityes of Iuda Ꟶ without Ierusalem (which also shalbe so voyde, that nether people ner catell shall dwell there)
Jer.33.11	shall the voyce of gladnes be hearde agayne, the voyce of the brydegrome Ꟶ of the bryde, the voyce of them that shall singe: Prayse the Lorde of hoostes, for he is louynge and hys mercy endureth for euer: and the voyce of them that shall offer vp giftes in the house of the Lorde. For I will restore the captiuitie of this lande, as it was afore, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.33.12	Thus sayeth the Lorde of hoostes: It shall come yet therto, that in thys lande, which is voyde from men and catell, and in all the cityes of the lande, there shalbe set vp shepherdes cotages:
Jer.33.13	in the cityes vpon the mountaynes: and in the cyties that lye vpon the playne, and in the cyties of the southe. In the lande of BenIamin, in the feldes of Ierusalem, and in the cyties of Iuda shall the shepe be nombred agayne, vnder the hande of hym, that telleth them, sayeth the Lord
Jer.33.14	Beholde, the tyme commeth, sayeth the Lorde, that I will perfourme that good thynge, which I haue promised vnto the house of Israel and to the house of Iuda.
Jer.33.15	In those dayes and at the same tyme, I wyll bring forth vnto Dauid, the braunche of ryghtuousnes, Ꟶ he shall do equytie Ꟶ righteousnesse in the lande.
Jer.33.16	In those dayes shall Iuda be helped and Ierusalem shall dwell safe, and he that shall call her is euen God oure ryghteousnesse.
Jer.33.17	For thus the Lorde promyseth. Dauid shall neuer want one, to syt vpon the throne of the house of Israel:
Jer.33.18	nether shall the prestes and Leuites want one to offre allwaye before me burntofferinges, to kyndle the meatofferynges, and to prepare the sacrifyces.
Jer.33.19	And the worde of the Lord came vnto Ieremy after this maner.
Jer.33.20	Thus sayeth the Lord: maye the couenaunt which I haue made wt daye and nyght be broken, that there shulde not be daye and nyght in due season?
Jer.33.21	Then maye my couenaunt also be broken, which I made wt Dauid my seruaunte, and so he not to haue a sonne to reygne in hys throne. so shall also the prestes Ꟶ Leuites neuer fayle, but serue me.
Jer.33.22	For lyke as the starres of heauen maye not be nombred, nether the sande of the see measured: so wyll I multiplye the sede of Dauid my seruaunt, Ꟶ the Leuites my ministers.
Jer.33.23	Moreouer, the worde of the Lorde came to Ieremy, saying:
Jer.33.24	Consydrest thou not what this people speaketh? Two kynreddes (saye they) had the Lorde chosen, Ꟶ those same two hath he cast awaye. For so they haue despised my people Ꟶ they reputed them as though they were no people,
Jer.33.25	Therfore thus saieth the Lorde: If I haue made no couenaunt with daye Ꟶ nyght, Ꟶ geuen no statute vnto heauen Ꟶ earth:
Jer.33.26	then will I also cast awaye the sede of Iacob Ꟶ Dauid my seruaunt: so that I will take no prince out of his sede, to rule the posteritie of Abraham, Isaac Ꟶ Iacob. But yet I wil turne agayne their captiuitie, Ꟶ be mercyfull vnto them.
Jer.34.1	These are the wordes which the Lord spake vnto Ieremy what tyme as Nabuchodonosor the kynge of Babylon, Ꟶ all his Hostes (out of all the kingdomes that were vnder his power) Ꟶ all hys people, fought agaynst Ierusalem and all the cyties therof.
Jer.34.2	Thus sayeth the Lorde God of Israel: Goo, Ꟶ speake to zedekiah the kynge of Iuda, and tell hym. The Lorde sendeth the thys worde: Beholde, I wyll delyuer thys cytie into the hande of the kyng of Babylon, he shall burne it,
Jer.34.3	and thou shalt not escape hys handes, but shalt be led awaye presoner, and deliuered into his power. Thou shalt loke the kynge of Babylon in the face, and he shal speake with the, mouth to mouth and then shalt thou goo to Babilon.
Jer.34.4	Yet heare the worde of the Lorde, O zedekiah thou kynge of Iuda: Thus sayeth the Lorde vnto the. Thou shalt not be slayne with the swearde,
Jer.34.5	but shalt dye in peace. Lyke as thy fore fathers the kynges, thy progenitours, were brente: so shalt thou be brent also, and in thy mourninge they shall saye: oh Lord. For thus haue I determyned, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.34.6	Then spake Ieremy the prophet all these wordes vnto zedekiah kynge of Iuda in Ierusalem:
Jer.34.7	what tyme as the kynge of Babylons hooste beseged Ierusalem, and the remnaunt of the cyties. Namely, Lachis and Azecach, which yet remayned of the stronge defensed cyties of Iuda.
Jer.34.8	These are the wordes that the Lord spake vnto Ieremy the prophete, when zedekiah was agreed with all the people at Ierusalem, that there shulde be proclamed a libertie:
Jer.34.9	so that euery man shuld let his seruaunt Ꟶ handmayde go fre, Hebrue and Hebruesse, and no Iewe to holde hys brother as a bonde man.
Jer.34.10	Nowe as they had consented, all the princes and all the people which had gathered vnto this agrement that euery man shulde set at lybertie his bonde seruaunte and bonde woman and no longer to holde them bonde euen so they were obedient, Ꟶ let them go free.
Jer.34.11	But afterwarde they repented, and toke agayne the seruauntes and hande maydens, whom they had lett go free, and so made them bonde againe.
Jer.34.12	For the which cause the worde of the Lorde came vnto Ieremye from the Lorde hym selfe, sayinge:
Jer.34.13	Thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel: I made a couenaunt with youre fathers, when I brought them out of Egypt, (that they shulde no more be bondmen) sayinge.
Jer.34.14	When seuen yeares are oute, euery man shall let hys bought seruaunte an Hebrue go fre, yf he haue serued hym syxe yeares. But youre fathers obeyed me not Ꟶ herkened not vnto me.
Jer.34.15	As for you, ye were nowe turned, Ꟶ did right before me, in that ye proclamed, eueryman to let his neighboure go free, and in that ye made a couenaunt before me, in the temple that beareth my name.
Jer.34.16	But yet ye haue turned youre selues agayne, and blasphemed my name. In this, that euery man hath requyred his seruaunt Ꟶ handmayden agayne, whom ye had let go quyte and fre, Ꟶ compelled them to serue you agayne, and to be youre bonde men, and bondwemen.
Jer.34.17	And therfore thus sayeth the Lorde: ye haue not obeyed me, euery man to proclame fredome vnto his brother Ꟶ neyghboure: wherfore, I wyll call you vnto a fredome, sayeth the Lord: euen vnto the swearde, to the pestilence, Ꟶ to honger, Ꟶ will make you to be plaged in all the kyngdomes of the earth.
Jer.34.18	Yee, those men that haue broken my couenaunt, Ꟶ not kepte the wordes of the appoyntement, which they made before me: when they hewed the calfe in two, Ꟶ when there wente thorowe the two halfes therof:
Jer.34.19	The Prynces of Iuda, the Princes of Ierusalem, the gelded men, the Prestes and all the people of the lande, which wente thorowe the two sydes of the calfe.
Jer.34.20	Those men wyll I geue into the power of theyr enemies, Ꟶ into the handes of them that folowe vpon theyr lyues. And their deed bodies shalbe meate for the foules of the ayre, Ꟶ beastes of the felde.
Jer.34.21	As for zedekiah the kynge of Iuda and hys Prynces, I wyll delyuer them into the power of their enemyes, and of them that desyre to slaye them, and into the hande of the kynge of Babylons hoste which nowe is departed from you:
Jer.34.22	But thorow my commaundement (sayeth the Lorde) they shal come agayne before thys cytye, they shall fyght agaynst it, wynne it, and burne it: Moreouer, I wyll laye the cyties of Iuda so waste, that no man shall dwell therin.
Jer.35.1	The wordes whyche the Lorde spake vnto Ieremy, in the raynge of Iehoakim the sonne of Iosiah kyng of Iuda, are these:
Jer.35.2	Go vnto the house of the Rechabites, Ꟶ call them out, and bringe them to the house of the Lorde into some commodyous place, and geue then wyne to dryncke.
Jer.35.3	Then toke I Iazaniah the sonne of Ieremy the sonne of Habaziniah, and his brethren, Ꟶ all his sonnes, and the whole housholde of the Rechabytes:
Jer.35.4	and brought them to the house of the Lorde into the closet of the chyldren of Hanan the sonne of Iegedaliah the man of God: which was by the closet of the Princes that is aboue the closet of Maasiah the sonne of Selum, which is the treasurer.
Jer.35.5	And before the sonnes of the kynred of the Rechabytes, I set pottes full of wyne, and cuppes, Ꟶ sayde vnto them: Drincke wyne.
Jer.35.6	But they sayde: we wyll dryncke no wyne for Ionadab the sonne of Rechab oure father commaunded vs, saying: ye and youre sonnes shall neuer dryncke wyne buylde no houses, sowe no sede, plante no vynes,
Jer.35.7	yee, ye shal haue no vineyardes: but for all youre tyme ye shall dwell in tentes, that ye maye lyue longe in the lande wherin ye be straungers.
Jer.35.8	Thus haue we obeyed the commaundement of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab oure father in all that he hath charged vs, Ꟶ so we drynke no wyne all oure lyfe longe: we, nor oure wyues, our sonnes and oure daughters.
Jer.35.9	Nether builde we any house to dwell therin, we haue also amonge vs nether vineyardes, ner cornelande to sowe:
Jer.35.10	but we dwell in tentes, we obeye, and do accordynge vnto all, that Ionadab oure father commaunded vs.
Jer.35.11	But now that Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came vp into the lande, we sayde, come, lett vs go to Ierusalem, that we maye escape the hooste of the Caldees and the Assyrians: and so we dwell now at Ierusalem.
Jer.35.12	Then came the worde of the Lorde vnto Ieremy saying.
Jer.35.13	Thus sayeth the Lord of hoostes the God of Israel: Go and tell the men of Iuda and the inhabitours of Ierusalem: Will ye not be refourmed, to obey my wordes saieth the Lorde?
Jer.35.14	The wordes which Ionadab the sonne of Rechab commaunded his sonnes, that they shulde drynke no wyne, are fast and surely kept: for vnto thys daye they dryncke no wyne, but obeye their fathers commaundement. But as for me, I haue stand vp early, I haue spoken vnto you, Ꟶ geuen you earnest warnynge: Ꟶ yet haue ye not bene obedient vnto me.
Jer.35.15	Yee, I haue sent my seruauntes, all the prophetes vnto you, I rose vp early, Ꟶ sent you worde, sayinge: O turne you, nowe euery man from his wycked waye: amende youre lyues, and go not after straunge goddes, to worshyppe them: that ye maye continue in the lande, which I haue geuen vnto you Ꟶ youre fathers, but ye wolde nether heare me, ner folowe me.
Jer.35.16	The chyldren of Ionadab Rechabs sonne haue stedfastly kepte their fathers commaundement, that he gaue them, but this people is not obedient vnto me.
Jer.35.17	And therfore thus sayeth the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel: Beholde, I will bringe vpon Iuda Ꟶ vpon euery one that dwelleth in Ierusalem, all the trouble that I haue deuysed agaynst them. For I haue spoken vnto them, but they wold not folowe. I haue called vnto them, neuertheles they wold geue me no answere.
Jer.35.18	Ieremy also spake vnto the housholde of the Rechabites: Thus sayeth the Lord of Hostes the God of Israell: For so moche as ye haue obeyed the commaundement of Ionadab youre father, and kepte all hys preceptes, and done accordyng vnto all that he hath bydden you:
Jer.35.19	Therfore thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes, the God of Israel: Ionadab the sonne of Rechab shall not fayle, but haue one out of his stocke to stande alwaye before me.
Jer.36.1	In the fourth yeare of Iehoakim the sonne of Iosiah Kynge of Iuda, came the worde of the Lord vnto Ieremy, sayinge.
Jer.36.2	Take a boke, and wryte therin all the wordes, that I haue spoken to the, agaynst Israel agaynst Iuda, and agaynst all the people, from the tyme that I beganne for to speake vnto the (in the raygne of Iosiah) vnto thys daye.
Jer.36.3	That when the house of Iuda heareth of the plage, which I haue deuysed for them, they maye peraduenture turne, euery man from hys wycked waye, that I maye forgeue theyr offences and synnes.
Jer.36.4	Then dyd Ieremy call Baruch the sonne of Neriah, and Baruch wrote in the boke at the mouth of Ieremy, all the wordes of the Lorde, which he had spoken vnto hym.
Jer.36.5	And Ieremy commaunded Baruch, sayinge: I am in preson, so that I maye not come into the house of the Lorde:
Jer.36.6	therfore go thou thyther, and reade the boke, that thou hast wryten at my mouth: Namely, the wordes of the Lord and rede them in the Lordes house vpon the fastynge daye, that the people, whole Iuda, and all they that come out of the cities, maye heare.
Jer.36.7	Peraduenture they wyll praye mekely before the face of the Lorde, Ꟶ turne euery one from hys wycked waye. For greate is the wrath and displeasure, that the Lorde hath taken agaynst this people:
Jer.36.8	So Baruch the sonne of Neriah dyd, accordinge vnto all that Ieremy the Prophete commaunded him, readinge the wordes of the Lorde out of the boke in the Lordes house.
Jer.36.9	And this was done in the fyft yeare of Iehoakim the sonne of Iosiah kynge of Iuda, in the .ix. moneth when it was commaunded, that all the people of Ierusalem shulde fast before the Lord, and they also that were come from the cyties of Iuda vnto Ierusalem.
Jer.36.10	Then redde Baruch the wordes of Ieremy out of the boke with in the house of the Lord out of the treasury of Gamariah the sonne of Saphan the Scribe, which is besyde the hyer lofte of the newe dore of the Lordes house: that all the people myght heare.
Jer.36.11	Nowe when Micheah the sonne of Gamariah the sonne of Saphan had hearde all the wordes of the Lorde out of the boke,
Jer.36.12	he wente downe to the kynges palace into the Scrybes chambres, for there all the Prynces were set. Elysama the Scribe, Dalaiah the sonne of Semei, Elnathan the sonne of Achbor, Gamariah the sonne of Saphan, zedekiah the sonne of Hananiah, with all the Prynces.
Jer.36.13	And Micheah tolde them all the wordes, that he hearde Baruch reade out of the boke before the people.
Jer.36.14	Then all the princes sent Iehudi the sonne of Nathaniah, the sonne of Selamiah, the sonne of Chusi, vnto Baruch, saying. Take in thyne hande the boke, wherout thou hast red before all the people, and come. So Baruch the sonne of Neriah toke the boke in his hande, Ꟶ came vnto them.
Jer.36.15	And they sayd vnto him. Syt downe, Ꟶ rede the boke that we maye heare also. So Baruch redd that they might here.
Jer.36.16	Nowe when they had hearde all the wordes, they were abashed one vpon another, and sayde vnto Baruch. We wyll certifye the kinge of all these wordes.
Jer.36.17	And they examyned Baruch, sayinge: tell vs, howe dydest thou write all these wordes out of hys mouth?
Jer.36.18	Then Baruch answered them: He spake all these wordes vnto me with his mouth, Ꟶ I wrote them in the boke.
Jer.36.19	Then sayde the princes vnto Baruch: Go thy waye, Ꟶ hyde the with Ieremy, so that no man knowe where ye be.
Jer.36.20	And they went into the kyng to the courte. But they kept the boke in the chambre of Elisama the Scribe, Ꟶ tolde the kyng all the wordes that he myght heare.
Jer.36.21	So the kyng sent Iehudi to fetch him the boke which he brought out of Elysama the Scribes chambre. And Iehudi red in it, that the kynge and all the prynces, which were aboute him, myght heare.
Jer.36.22	Nowe the kynge sat in the wynter house, for it was in the .ix. Moneth Ꟶ there was a fyre before him.
Jer.36.23	And when Iehudi had redde thre or foure leaues therof, he cut the boke in peces with a penne knyfe, and cast it into the fyre vpon the harth, vntyll the boke was all brente in the fyre vpon the harth.
Jer.36.24	Yet no man was abashed therof, or rente his clothes: nether the kynge hym selfe, ner his seruauntes, though they hearde all these wordes.
Jer.36.25	Neuerthelesse Elnathan, Dalaiah, Ꟶ Gamariah besought the kynge, that he wolde not burne the boke: not withstandynge the kynge wolde not heare them,
Jer.36.26	but commaunded Ierahmael the sonne of Amalech, Saraiah the sonne of Ezriel Ꟶ Selamiah the sonne of Abdiel, to laye handes vpon Baruch the Scrybe, and vpon Ieremy the Prophete: but the Lorde kepte them out of syght.
Jer.36.27	After nowe that the kynge had brent the boke, Ꟶ the sermons which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Ieremy: The worde of the Lord came vnto Ieremye, sayinge.
Jer.36.28	Take another boke, and wryte in it all the forsayde sermons: that were wryten in the fyrst boke, which Iehoakim the kynge of Iuda hath brente.
Jer.36.29	And tell Iehoakim the kynge of Iuda: thus sayeth the Lorde: thou hast brente the boke, Ꟶ thoughtest within thy selfe. Why hast thou wryten therin, that the kynge of Babylon shall come, and make thys lande waste: so that he shall make both people and catell to be out of it?
Jer.36.30	Therfore thus the Lorde sayeth of Iehoakim the kyng of Iuda. There shall none of hys generacyon syt vpon the throne of Dauid. Hys deed corse shalbe cast oute, that the heate of the daye, and the frost of the nyght maye come vpon hym.
Jer.36.31	And I wyll vyset the wyckednes of hym, of his sede, Ꟶ of hys seruauntes, Moreouer, all the euell that I haue promysed them (though they herde me not) wyll I bringe vpon them, vpon the inhabitoures of Ierusalem, and vpon all Iuda.
Jer.36.32	Then toke Ieremy another boke, and gaue it Baruch the Scribe the sonne of Neriah, whiche wrote therin out of the mouth of Ieremy: all the sermons that were in the fyrst boke, which Iehoakim the kyng of Iuda dyd burne. And there were added vnto them many mo sermons, then before.
Jer.37.1	zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah which was made kynge thorowe Nabuchodonosor kynge of Babylon, reigned in the lande of Iuda, in the steade of Cononiah the sonne of Iehoakim.
Jer.37.2	But nether he, ner hys seruauntes, ner the people in the lande wolde obeye the wordes of the Lorde, which he spake by the Prophet Ieremy.
Jer.37.3	Neuerthelesse, zedekiah the kyng sent Iehucal the sonne of Selemiah Ꟶ Sophoniah the sonne of Maasiah the Prest to the Prophet Ieremy, saying: O praye thou vnto the Lorde oure God for vs
Jer.37.4	Nowe Ieremy walked fre amonge the people at that tyme, and was not put in preson as yet.
Jer.37.5	Pharaos hoste also was come out of Egypte: which when the Caldees that beseged Ierusalem perceaued, they departed from thence.
Jer.37.6	Then came the worde of the Lorde vnto Ieremy the Prophet, sayinge:
Jer.37.7	Thus sayeth the Lorde God of Israel, thys answere shall ye geue to the kynge of Iuda, that sent you vnto me for councell: Beholde, Pharaos hoste which is come forth to helpe you, shall returne to Egypte into his awne lande:
Jer.37.8	but the Caldees shall come agayne, and fyght agaynst thys cytie, wynne it, and sett fyre vpon it.
Jer.37.9	For thus sayeth the Lorde, disceaue not youre awne myndes, thynckinge on this maner: tush, the Caldees go now their waye from vs. No, they shall not go theyr waye.
Jer.37.10	For though ye had slayne the whole hoste of the Caldees, that besege you, and euery one of the slayne laye in his tente, yet shulde they stande vp, and set fyre vpon thys cyte.
Jer.37.11	Now when the hoste of the Caldees was broken vp from Ierusalem, for feare of the Egypcyans armye,
Jer.37.12	Ieremye went out of Ierusalem towarde the lande of BenIamin, to get hym from amonge the people.
Jer.37.13	And when he came vnder BenIamyns porte, there was a porter, called Ieriah, the sonne of Selemiah the sonne of Hananiah, which fell vpon him, and toke him sayinge: thy mynde is to runne to the Caldees.
Jer.37.14	Then sayde Ieremy: It is not so, I go not to the Caldees. Neuertheles, Ieriah wolde not beleue hym, but brought Ieremy bounde before the Princes.
Jer.37.15	Wherfore the princes were angrye with Ieremy, and smote him, and layed hym in preson in the house of Ionathas the scribe. For he was the rular of the preson.
Jer.37.16	Thus was Ieremy put into the dongeon and preson, and so laye there a longe tyme.
Jer.37.17	Then zedekiah the kyng sent for him, and called him, and asked hym quyetly in his awne house, sayinge: thynkest thou this busynes (that now is in hande) commeth of the Lorde? Ieremy answered: yee, that it doth: and thou (sayed he) shalt be delyuered into the kynge of Babylons power.
Jer.37.18	Moreouer, Ieremy sayde vnto kynge zedekiah. What haue I offended agaynst the, against thy seruauntes, or agaynst thys people, that ye haue put me in preson?
Jer.37.19	Where are youre prophetes which haue prophecyed vnto you, Ꟶ sayde, that the kynge of Babylon shulde not come agaynst you Ꟶ this lande?
Jer.37.20	And therfore heare nowe, O my Lorde the kynge: let my prayer be accepte before the, and sende me nomore into the house of Ionathas the Scrybe, that I dye not there.
Jer.37.21	Then zedekias the kynge commaunded to put Ieremy in the fore entrye of the preson, and dayly to be geuen hym a cake of bread out of the bakers streate vntyll all the bread in the cytie was eaten vp. Thus Ieremy remayned in the fore entry in the preson.
Jer.38.1	Saphatiah the sonne of Mathan, Godoliah the sonne of Phasphur, Iucal the sonne of Semeliah, and Phashur the sonne of Melchiah perceaued the wordes, that Ieremy had spoken vnto all the people, namely on thys maner:
Jer.38.2	Thus sayeth the Lord: Who so remayneth in thys cytie, shal perish, ether with the swearde, with honger or with the pestylence. But who so falleth vnto the Caldees, shall escape winnynge his soule for a praye, Ꟶ shall lyue.
Jer.38.3	For thus sayeth the Lorde: Thys cytie (no doute) must be delyuered into the power of the kynge of Babylon, and he also shall wynne it.
Jer.38.4	Then sayde the prynces vnto the kynge: Syr, we beseche you let thys man be put to death. For thus he discorageth the handes of the soudiers that be in thys cytie, and the handes of all the people, when he speaketh soche wordes vnto them. This man verely laboureth not for peace of the people, but myschefe.
Jer.38.5	zedekiah the kynge answered Ꟶ sayde: lo, he is in youre handes, for the kyng maye denye you nothinge.
Jer.38.6	Then toke they Ieremy, and cast hym into the dongeon of Melchiah the sonne of Hamelech, that dwelt in the fore entrie of the preson. And they lett downe Ieremy with coardes into a dongeon, where there was no water, but myre.
Jer.38.7	So Ieremy stack fast in the myre. Now when Abedmelech the Morian beynge a chamberlayne in the kynges courte, vnderstode, that they had cast Ieremy into the dongeon:
Jer.38.8	he went out of the kynges house, and spake to the kynge, (which then sat vnder the porte of BenIamin) these wordes:
Jer.38.9	My Lorde the kynge, where as these men medle with Ieremye the prophet, they do hym wronge: Namely, in that they haue put him in preson, there to dye of honger, for there is no more bread in the cytie.
Jer.38.10	Then the kynge commaunded Abedmelech the Morian and sayde: Take from hence .xxx. men whom thou wylt, Ꟶ drawe vp Ieremy the prophet out of the dongeon, before he dye.
Jer.38.11	So Abedmelech toke the men wt him, and went to the house of the kynge, and there vnder the treasurie gatt olde ragges Ꟶ worne cloutes, and lett them downe by a coarde, into the dongeon to Ieremy.
Jer.38.12	And Abedmelech the Morian sayde vnto the prophet Ieremy: O, put these ragges and cloutes vnder thyne arme holes, betwyxte them and the coardes: Ꟶ Ieremy dyd so.
Jer.38.13	So they drewe vp Ieremy with coardes Ꟶ toke him out of the dongeon, Ꟶ he remayned in the fore entrye of the preson.
Jer.38.14	Then zedekiah the kynge sent Ꟶ caused Ieremy the prophete to be called vnto him, into the thyrde entrye, that is in the house of the. Lord. And the kinge sayd vnto Ieremy: I will aske the somewhat but hyde nothynge fro me.
Jer.38.15	Then Ieremy answered zedekiah: Yf I be playne vnto the, thou wilt cause me to suffre death: If I geue the councell, thou wylt not folowe me.
Jer.38.16	So the king swore an ooth secretly vnto Ieremy, sayinge. As truly as the Lorde lyueth that made vs these soules, I wyll not slaye the, ner geue the into the handes of them that seke after thy lyfe.
Jer.38.17	Then sayde Ieremy vnto zedekiah. Thus sayeth the Lord of hoostes the God of Israel If case be, that thou wylt go forth vnto the kynge of Babylons prynces, thou shalt saue thy lyfe, and thys cytie shalt not be brent yee, both thou and thy housholde shall escape with youre lyues.
Jer.38.18	But yf thou wylt not go forth to the kynge of Babylons princes, then shall thys cytie be delyuered into the handes of the Caldees, which shall set fyre vpon it, and thou shalt not be able to escape them.
Jer.38.19	And zedekiah sayde vnto Ieremy. I am afrayde for the Iewes, that are fled vnto the Caldees, lest I come in theyr handes, and so they to haue me in derisyon.
Jer.38.20	But Ieremy answerde: No, they shall not betraye the: O herken vnto the voyce of the Lord (I beseche the) which I speake vnto the so shalt thou be well, and saue thy lyfe.
Jer.38.21	But yf thou wilt not go forth, the Lorde hath tolde me this playnely:
Jer.38.22	Beholde, all the wemen that are left in the kynge of Iudaes house, shalbe led forth out to the kynge of Babilons princes. And they shal saye, that thou art disceaued: and that they whom thou didest put thy trust, haue gotten the vnder, Ꟶ sett thy fete fast in the myre, and gone their waye from the.
Jer.38.23	Therfore all thy wyues with their chyldren shall they leade forth vnto the Caldees, and thou shalt not escape their handes, but shalt be the kyng of Babilons presoner, Ꟶ this cytie shalt thou cause to be brent.
Jer.38.24	Then sayde zedekiah vnto Ieremye: loke that no body knowe of these wordes, and thou shalt not dye.
Jer.38.25	But yf the princes perceaue, that I haue talked with the and come vnto the, saying: O speake, what sayde the king to the? hyde it not from vs, Ꟶ we wyll not put the to death. Tell vs (we praye the) what sayde the kynge to the?
Jer.38.26	Se thou geue them thys answere: I haue humbly besought the kynge, that he wyll lett me lye nomore in Iehonathans house, that I dye not there.
Jer.38.27	Then came all the princes vnto Ieremy, and asked hym. And he tolde them, after the maner as the kynge bad him. Then they helde theyr peace, and let hym alone for they perceaued nothinge.
Jer.38.28	So Ieremy abode styll in the fore entrie of the preson, vntyll the daye that Ierusalem was wonne.
Jer.39.1	Nowe when the cytie of Ierusalem was taken (for in the .ix. yeare of zedekiah Kynge of Iuda in the tenth Moneth, came Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon Ꟶ all his hoste, and beseged Ierusalem Ꟶ foughte agenst it.
Jer.39.2	And in the .xi. yeare of zedekiah in the fourth Moneth the .ix. daye of the Moneth, he brake into the cytie.)
Jer.39.3	Then all the princes of the king of Babylon, came in, Ꟶ sat them downe vnder the porte: Neregel, Sarezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsachim, Rabsaris, Neregel, Sarezer, Rabmag, wt all the other princes of the Kynge of Babylon.
Jer.39.4	And when zedekiah the Kynge of Iuda with hys soudiers sawe them, they fled, and departed out of the cytie by nyght thorowe the kynges garden, Ꟶ thorowe the porte that is betwene the two walles, and so they wente towarde the wyldernesse.
Jer.39.5	But the Caldees Hoste folowed faste after them, and toke zedekiah in the felde of Iericho, and brought hym presoner to Nabuchodonosor the kynge of Babylon vnto Reblath, that lyeth in the land of Hemath where he gaue iudgement vpon him.
Jer.39.6	So the kyng of Babylon caused the chyldren of zedekiah and all the nobles of Iuda be slayne, before hys face at Reblath.
Jer.39.7	And made zedekias eyes to be put out, and bounde him with two chaynes, and sent him to Babylon.
Jer.39.8	Moreouer, the Caldees brent vp the kynges palace, with the other houses of the people, and brake downe the walles of Ierusalem.
Jer.39.9	As for the remnaunt of the people that were in the cytie, and soch as were come to helpe them (whatsoeuer was left of the comen sorte) Nabuzaradan the chefe captayne caryed them to Babylon.
Jer.39.10	But Nabuzaradan the chefe captayne let the rascall people (Ꟶ those that had nothinge) dwell styll in the lande of Iuda, and gaue them vineyardes Ꟶ corne feldes at the same tyme.
Jer.39.11	Nabuchodonosor also the kynge of Babylon gaue Nabuzaradan the chefe captayne a charge, concernynge Ieremy, sayinge:
Jer.39.12	take and cherish hym, and make moche of him: se thou do hym no harme, but intreate him after his awne desyre.
Jer.39.13	So Nabuzaradan the chefe captayne, Nabusazban Rabsares, Nergal Sarezer Rabmag and all the kynge of Babylons Lordes sent for Ieremy
Jer.39.14	and caused hym to be fet out of the fore entrye of the preson, Ꟶ committed him vnto Godoliah the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Saphan: that he shulde carye him home, and so he dwelt amonge the people.
Jer.39.15	Now whyle Ieremy laye yet bounde in the fore entrie of the preson, the worde of the Lord came vnto him, sayinge:
Jer.39.16	Goo and tell Abedmelech the Morian: Thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes the God of Israel: Beholde, the cruell and sharpe plage that I haue deuysed for this cytie, will I bringe vpon them, that thou shalt se it:
Jer.39.17	but I wyll delyuer the (sayeth the Lorde) and thou shalt not come in the handes of those men, whom thou fearest.
Jer.39.18	For doutles I wyll saue the, so that thou shalt not perish wt the swearde: but thy lyfe shalbe saued, and that because thou hast put thy trust in me, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.40.1	Thys is the worde that the Lord spake vnto Ieremy, when Nabuzaradan the chefe Captayne had let him go fre from Ramah, whyther he had led him bounde amonge all the presoners, that were caryed from Ierusalem and Iuda vnto Babylon.
Jer.40.2	The chefe captayne called for Ieremy, and sayde vnto hym. The Lorde thy God spake myghtely before of the mysery vpon thys place:
Jer.40.3	Nowe the Lorde had sent it, and perfourmed it as he had promysed. For ye haue synned agaynst the Lord, and haue not bene obedient vnto his voyce, therfore commeth thys plage vpon you.
Jer.40.4	Beholde, I lowse the bondes from thy handes thys daye: yf thou wilt nowe go with me vnto Babylon, vp then: for I wyll se to the, Ꟶ prouyde for the. But yf thou wylt not go with me to Babylon, then remayne here. Beholde, all the lande is at thy wyll, loke wher thou thynkest conuenient and good for the to abyde, there dwell.
Jer.40.5	For as yet he was not gone backe againe to Godoliah therfore he sayde to him: Go backe to Godoliah the sonne of Ahicam, the sonne of Saphan: whom the kynge of Babylon hath made gouernoure ouer the cyties of Iuda, Ꟶ dwell with hym amonge the people, or remayne where soeuer it pleaseth the. So the chefe Captayne gaue him hys expenses with a rewarde, and let him go.
Jer.40.6	Then wente Ieremy vnto Godoliah the sonne of Ahikam to Mizpa, and dwelt there with hym among the people that were left in the lande.
Jer.40.7	Nowe when the captaynes of the Hoste of Iuda (which wt their felowes were scatred abrode on euery syde in the lande) vnderstode that the kynge of Babylon made Godoliah the sonne of Ahicam gouernoure in the land, and the man, wyfe and childe, yee, and the poore men in the lande (that were not led captyue to Babylon) shulde be vnder his iurisdiccion:
Jer.40.8	They came to Godoliah vnto Mizpa: Namely, Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah, Iohanan and Ionathan the sonnes of Careah, Sareah the sonne of Thanhometh, the sonnes of Ophai the Netophathite, Iesaniah the sonne of Maachati, with theyr companyons.
Jer.40.9	And Godaliah the sonne of Ahicam, the sonne of Saphan, swore vnto them and theyr felowes in this maner Be not afrayed to serue the Caldees, dwell in the lande, and do the kyng of Babylon seruice, so shall ye prospere.
Jer.40.10	Beholde, I dwell at Mizpa to be an officer in the Caldees be halfe, and to satisfye soche as come to vs. Therfore gather you wyne, corne and oyle, and kepe them in your ware houses, and dwell in youre cyties that ye haue in kepynge.
Jer.40.11	Yee, all the Iewes also that dwelt in Moab vnder the Ammonites, in Idumea and in all the countreys, when they herde, that the kinge of Babylon had made Godoliah the sonne of Ahicam the sonne of Saphan, gouernoure vpon them that were left in Iuda.
Jer.40.12	All the Iewes (I saye) returned oute of all places where they were fled vnto: and came into the lande of Iuda to Godoliah vnto Mizpa, Ꟶ gathered wyne Ꟶ other frutes, Ꟶ that very moche.
Jer.40.13	Moreouer, Iohanan the sonne of Careah and all the captaynes of the Hoste, that were scatred on euery syde in the lande, cam to Godoliah in Mizpa, Ꟶ sayde vnto him.
Jer.40.14	knowest thou not that Baalis kynge of the Ammonites hath sent Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah, to slaye the? But Godoliah the sonne of Ahicam beleued them not.
Jer.40.15	Then sayde Iohanan the sonne of Careah vnto Godoliah in Mizpa these wordes secretly: Let me go, I praye the, and I will slaye Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah, so that no body shall knowe it. Wherfore will he kyll the, that all the Iewes which resorte vnto the, might be scatred and the remnaunt in Iuda peryshe.
Jer.40.16	And Godoliah the sonne of Ahikam sayde to Iohanan the sonne of Careah. Thou shalt not do it, for they are but lyes, that thou sayest, of Ismael.
Jer.41.1	But in the seuenth Moneth it happened, the Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah the sonne of Elisama (one of the kynges bloude) came with them that were greatest aboute the kynge, Ꟶ ten men that were sworne with him: vnto Godoliah the sonne of Ahicam to Mizpa, Ꟶ they dyd eate together.
Jer.41.2	And Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah with those ten men that were sworne to him, starte vp, and smote Godoliah the sonne of Ahicam the sonne of Saphan with the swearde, and slewe him, whom the kynge of Babylon had made gouernoure of the lande.
Jer.41.3	Ismael also slewe all the Iewes that were with Godoliah at Mizpa, and all the Caldees that he founde there waytynge vpon hym and those that were able to fyght they slewe with hym.
Jer.41.4	The nexte daye after that he had slayne Godoliah (the matter was yet vnknowne)
Jer.41.5	Ꟶ there came certayne men from Sichem, from Siloh and Samaria, to the nombre of .lxxx. which had shauen theyr beardes, rent theyr clothes, and were all heuye, bringynge meatoffringes, Ꟶ incense in their handes to offre it in the house of the Lorde.
Jer.41.6	And Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah went forth of Mizpa wepinge, to mete them. Nowe when he met them, he sayde: Go youre waye to Godoliah the sonne of Ahicam.
Jer.41.7	And when they came in the myddest of the cytie, Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah (wt them that were sworne vnto him) slewe them, euen at the myddest of the pyt.
Jer.41.8	Amonge these .lxxx. men there were ten, that sayde vnto Ismael: Oh slaye vs not, for we haue yet a great treasure in the felde, of wheate barley, oyle and hony. So he spared them, Ꟶ slewe them not with theyr brethren.
Jer.41.9	Nowe the pyt wherin Ismael dyd cast the deed bodies of the men (whom he slewe because of Godoliah) had kynge Asa caused to be made, for feare of Baasa the kyng of Israel, and the same pyt dyd Ismael fyll with slayne men
Jer.41.10	As for the remnaunt of the people, the kynges daughters and all the people that were yet left at Mizpa, vpon whom Nabusaradan the chefe Captayne had made Godoliah the sonne of Ahicam gouernoure: Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah caryed them awaye presoners towarde the Ammonites.
Jer.41.11	But when Iohanan the sonne of Careah Ꟶ all they which had bene captaynes ouer the kynges Hoste with hym, herde of all the wyckednes that Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah had done:
Jer.41.12	they toke theyr companions, Ꟶ went out for to fyght wt Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah, and founde him by the greate waters that are in Gibeon.
Jer.41.13	Nowe when all the people, whom Ismael led captiue, sawe Iohanan the sonne of Careah and all the other Captaines of the Hoste, they were glad.
Jer.41.14	So all the people that Ismael had caryed awaye from Mizpa, were brought agayne. And when they returned, they came to Iohanan the sonne of Careah.
Jer.41.15	But Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah fled from Iohanan with eyght of hys sworne companyons, Ꟶ wente to the Ammonites.
Jer.41.16	Then Iohanan the sonne of Careah and all the captaynes of the Hoste that were with him, toke all the remnaunt of the people, whom Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah had led a waye. (When he had slayne Godoliah the sonne of Ahicam) whom they also had rescued from hym: fyghtinge men, wemen Ꟶ chyldren, Ꟶ gelded men, whom they brought agayne from Gibeon:
Jer.41.17	and wente from thence, Ꟶ sat them downe at Geruth Camaam, whiche lyeth besyde Bethlehem that they myght go into Egypte for feare of the Caldees:
Jer.41.18	of whome they were afrayed, because that Ismael the sonne of Nathaniah had slayne Godoliah Ahikams sonne whom the kynge of Babylon had made gouernoure in the lande.
Jer.42.1	So all the captaynes, Ꟶ Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, Iezaniah the sonne of Osayah came with all the people from the leest vnto the most,
Jer.42.2	and sayde vnto Ieremy the prophete. O heare oure peticion, that thou mayest praye for vs vnto the Lorde thy God, namely, for all the remnaunt, wherof there be very fewe of vs left of many, as thou seest vs:
Jer.42.3	that the Lorde, thy God may shew vs a waye to go in, Ꟶ tell vs, what we shulde do.
Jer.42.4	Then Ieremy the prophet sayde vnto them: I haue herde you. Behold I will praye vnto God youre Lorde as ye haue requyred me: and loke what answere the Lord geueth you, I shall certifye you therof, and kepe nothynge back from you.
Jer.42.5	And they sayde vnto Ieremy. The Lord of trueth Ꟶ faithfulnes be oure recorde, that we wyll do all that the Lorde thy God commaundeth vs,
Jer.42.6	whether it be good or euell. We wyll herken vnto the voyce of oure Lorde God to whom we sende the, that we maye prospere, when we haue folowed the voyce of the Lorde oure God.
Jer.42.7	And after ten dayes came the worde of Lorde vnto Ieremy.
Jer.42.8	Then called he Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, Ꟶ all the captaynes of the people that were with him: yee, and all the people from the leest to the moost,
Jer.42.9	and sayde vnto them: Thus sayeth the Lorde God of Israel vnto whom ye sent me, to laye forth your prayers before him:
Jer.42.10	If ye wyll dwell in this lande, I shall buylde you vp, and not breake you downe: I shall plante you, and not rote you out: for I repent, as concernynge the trouble that I haue done to you.
Jer.42.11	Feare not the kynge of Babylon, of whom ye stand in awe, O, be not afrayed of him, sayeth the Lorde: for I wyll be wt you, to helpe you, and delyuer you from his hande.
Jer.42.12	I wyll pardon you, I wyll haue mercy vpon you, and cause him to pytie you, Ꟶ bringe you agayne into youre awne lande.
Jer.42.13	Neuertheles, yf ye purpose not to dwell in this lande, ner to folowe the voyce of the Lorde youre God:
Jer.42.14	but wyll saye thus, we will not dwell here, but go into Egypt: where we shal nether se warre, heare the noyse of the trompe, ner suffre honger, there wyll we dwell.
Jer.42.15	Wherfore, heare nowe the worde of the Lord, O ye remnaunt of Iuda. Thus sayeth the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel: If ye be wholy purposed to go into Egypte, Ꟶ ye entre ther to dwell as straungers:
Jer.42.16	the swearde that ye feared shall ouer take you in Egypte and the honger wherof ye be here afrayed shall hange vpon you Ꟶ folowe you into Egypte, and there ye shall dye.
Jer.42.17	And all they, that of sett purpose vndertake to go into Egipte to soiourne there, shall perysh with the swearde, with honger and pestilence: not one of them shall remayne, there shall none escape the plage, that I wyll brynge vpon them.
Jer.42.18	For thus sayeth the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel: lyke as my wrath and indygnacyon is moued agaynst the inhabitatours of Ierusalem, so shall my displeasure be kyndled agaynst you also, yf ye go into Egypte: Ꟶ there ye shalbe reuyled, abhorred, brought to shame and confusyon: and as for thys place, ye shall neuer se it more.
Jer.42.19	The Lorde forbyddeth you, O ye remnaunt of Iuda, that ye shall not go into Egypte. And forget not that I haue warned you earnestly this daye,
Jer.42.20	for ye haue dissembled wt me. For ye sent me vnto the Lorde youre God, and sayde: O praye thou the Lord oure God for vs: and loke what answere the Lorde oure God geueth the, that bryng vs agayne, and we shall do therafter.
Jer.42.21	Nowe haue I shewed, and declared vnto you, but you haue not obeyed the voyce of the Lord youre God, for the whych cause he hath sent me to you.
Jer.42.22	Nowe therfore, If ye wyll not folowe it, be sure, that ye shall perishe with the swearde, with honger and pestilence: euen in the same place, where youre lust is to go, and dwell.
Jer.43.1	Nowe when Ieremy had ended all the wordes of the Lord his God vnto the people which to declare the Lorde theyr God had sent hym to them, (euen all thes wordes I saye)
Jer.43.2	Azariah the sonne of Osaiah, and Iohanan the sonne of Kareah with all the stubborne personnes, sayde vnto Ieremy: Thou lyest; the Lorde oure God hath not sent the to speake vnto vs, that we shulde not go into Egypte, and dwell there:
Jer.43.3	But Baruch the sonne of Neriah prouoketh the agaynst vs, that he myght brynge vs into the captiuyte of the Caldees: that they might slaye vs, and carye vs awaye presoners vnto Babylon.
Jer.43.4	So Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaynes of the hooste, and all the people folowed not the commaundement of the Lorde: Namely, to dwell in the lande of Iuda.
Jer.43.5	But Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaynes of the hooste, caried awaye all the remnaunt in Iuda, that were come together agayne from all the Heythen (among whom they had bene scatred) to dwell in the lande of Iuda:
Jer.43.6	Men, wemen, chyldren, the kynges daughters, all those that Nabuzaradan the chefe captayne had lefte with Godoliah the sonne of Ahikam, the sonne of Saphan. They caryed awaye also the prophete Ieremy, Baruch the sonne of Neriah,
Jer.43.7	and so came into Egypte: for they were not obedyent, vnto the commaundement of God. Thus came they to Taphnis.
Jer.43.8	And in Taphnis the worde of the Lorde happened vnto Ieremy, saying:
Jer.43.9	Take great stones in thyne hande, and hyde them in the bryck wall, vnder the dore of Pharaos house in Taphnis, that all the men of Iuda maye se,
Jer.43.10	and saye vnto them: Thus sayth the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel. Beholde, I wyll sende and call for Nabuchodonosor the kynge of Babylon my seruaunt, and wyll sett his seate vpon these stones that I haue hyd, and he shall sprede his tente ouer them.
Jer.43.11	And when he commeth, he shall smyte the lande of Egypte, some with slaughter, some with presonment, and some with the swearde.
Jer.43.12	He shall set fyre vpon the temples of the Egypcians goddes, and burne them vp, Ꟶ take them selues presoners. Moreouer, he shall araye him selfe with the lande of Egypte, lyke as a shepherde putteth on hys cote, and shall departe his waye from thence in peace.
Jer.43.13	The pylers also of the temple of the Sunne that is in Egypte: shall he breake in peces, and burne the tempels of the Egypcians goddes.
Jer.44.1	This is the worde that was shewed to Ieremy, concernyng all the Iewes: which dwelt in Egypte: at Migdol, at Taphnis, at Noph, Ꟶ in the lande of Patures.
Jer.44.2	Thus sayethe the Lorde of hostes, the God of Israel: Ye haue sene all the misery, that I haue brought vpon Ierusalem, and vpon the cityes of Iuda: so that thys daye they are desolate, and no man dwellynge therin:
Jer.44.3	and that because of the greate blasphemies which they committed, to prouoke me vnto anger. In that they went backe to do sacrifyce and worship vnto straunge goddes: whom nether ye, ner youre fathers haue knowne.
Jer.44.4	Howebeit, I sent vnto them my seruauntes all the prophetes. I rose vp early, I sent vnto them, and gaue them warnyng. O do no soche abhominable thynges, Ꟶ thynges that I hate.
Jer.44.5	But they wolde not folowe ner herken, to turne from their wickednes, Ꟶ to do nomore sacrifyces vnto straunge goddes.
Jer.44.6	Wherfore myne indignation and wrath was kyndled, and it brente vp the cytyes of Iuda, the feldes with the stretes of Ierusalem, so that they were made waste and desolate, as it is come to passe thys daye.
Jer.44.7	Nowe therfore, thus sayth the Lorde of hoostes, the God of Israel: Howe happeneth it, that ye do so greate euyll vnto youre awne soules: thus to destroye the men and wemen, chyldren and babes of Iuda? so that none of you is lefte,
Jer.44.8	because ye prouoke me vnto wrathe with the worckes of youre awne handes: when ye offer vnto straunge goddes in the lande of Egipt, where as ye be gone to dwell. That ye myght vtterly peryshe, and that ye myght be reuyled and shamefully intreated of all natyons.
Jer.44.9	Or haue ye nowe forgotten the wickednes of your forefathers, the wickednes of the kinges of Iuda and their wyues, the wyckednes that ye youre selues and youre wyues haue done in the lande of Iuda, in the cytie and in the lande of Ierusalem.
Jer.44.10	Yet are ye not sory vnto this daye, ye feare not, nether walke ye in my lawe and in my commaundementes, that I haue geuen vnto you and youre forefathers.
Jer.44.11	Therfore thus sayeth the Lorde of hoostes, the God of Israel: I am stedfastly aduised and determyned to punysshe you, Ꟶ to rote out all Iuda.
Jer.44.12	As for the remnaunt of Iuda, that purposly wente into Egipt, ther to dwell, I wyll take them, and they shall all be destroyed. In the lande of Egypt shall they perysshe, beynge consumed with the swearde and with honger. For from the leest vnto the moost, they shall perysshe with the swearde and with honger. Moreouer, they shalbe reuyled, abhorred, shamed, and confounded.
Jer.44.13	For I wyll viset them that dwell in Egypte, as I haue visyted Ierusalem, with the swearde, with honger and with pestilence.
Jer.44.14	So that none of the remnaunt of Iuda, which are gone to dwell in Egipte, shall be left to come agayne into the lande of Iuda all though they thynke to come thyther agayne, and to dwell there. For none shall come agayne, but soch as are fledd awaye.
Jer.44.15	Then all the men which knewe that their wyues had offred vnto straunge goddes, and a greate sorte of wyues that stode there, yee, and all the people that dwelt there in Egipt in the cytie of Patures, answerde Ieremye, and sayde:
Jer.44.16	As for the wordes that thou hast spoken vnto vs, in the name of the Lorde, we wyll in no wyse heare them:
Jer.44.17	but whatsoeuer goeth out of oure awne mouthe, that we wyll do. We wyll do sacrifyce and offer oblatyons vnto the quene of heauen, lyke as we and our forefathers, oure kynges and oure heades haue done in the cytie of Iuda, and in the stretes and feldes of Ierusalem. For then had we plenteousnes of vitayles, then were we in prosperyte, and no mysfortune came vpon vs.
Jer.44.18	But sens we left to burne incense, and to do sacrifyce vnto the quene of heauen, we haue had scarcenesse of all thynges, and perisshe with the swearde and honger.
Jer.44.19	Last of all, when we wemen dyd sacrifyce and offered vnto the quene of heauen, dyd we make her cakes and poure vnto her drinckofferinges, euen to that ymage dyd we sacrifyce and seruice, without oure husbandes wylles?
Jer.44.20	Then sayde Ieremy vnto all the people, to the men, to the wemen, and to all the folke, which had geuen him that answere:
Jer.44.21	Dyd not the Lorde remember the sacrifyces that ye, youre forefathers, youre kynges and rulers, with all the people, haue offered in the cyties of Iuda, in the stretes and lande of Ierusalem? and hath he not consydered thys in his mynde?
Jer.44.22	In somoch that the Lorde might no longer suffer the wyckednes of youre inuencyons, and the abhomynable thynges, which ye dyd? Is not youre lande desolate and voyde: yee, abhorred and accursed, so that no man dwelleth therein eny more, as it is come to passe thys daye?
Jer.44.23	Dyd not all thys happen vnto you, because ye made soch sacrifyces to ydols, and synned agaynst the Lorde. Ye haue not folowed hys voyce, to walke in hys lawe, in his ordynaunces and statutes. Yee, this is the cause, that all misfortune happened vnto you, as it is come to passe this daye.
Jer.44.24	Moreouer, Ieremy spake vnto all the people and to all the wemen. Heare the worde of the Lorde all Iuda, ye that be in the lande of Egipt.
Jer.44.25	Thus sayth the Lord of hoostes the God of Israel. Ye and your wyues haue spoken with youre awne mouth, the thinge that ye haue fulfylled in dede. Yee, thus haue ye sayde: We wyll nott fayle, but perfourme the vowes that we haue vowed, we will do sacrifyce Ꟶ powre out drinckofferinges to the quene of heauen. Purposly wyll ye set vp your awne meanynges and perfourme your vowes.
Jer.44.26	And therfore, heare the wordes of the Lorde, all Iuda, ye that dwell in the lande of Egipte. Beholde, I haue sworne by my greate name, sayth the Lorde: that my name shall not be rehearsed thorowe eny mans mouthe of Iuda, in all the lande of Egipte, to saye: The Lorde God lyueth,
Jer.44.27	for I wyll watche, to plage them, and not for theyr wealthe. And all the men of Iuda that be in the lande of Egypte shall peryshe with the swearde, and with honger, vntyll they be vtterly destroyed.
Jer.44.28	Neuertheles, those that fledd awaye for the swearde, shall come agayne into the lande of Iuda: but there shall be very feawe of them. And all the remnaunt of Iuda, that are gone into Egypte, there to dwell, shall knowe whose wordes shall be founde true: theyrs or myne.
Jer.44.29	Take thys for a token that I wyll viset you in this place, sayth the Lord: and that ye maye knowe that I (without doubte) will perfourme my purpose vpon you to punyshe you.
Jer.44.30	Beholde, sayth the Lorde, I wyll delyuer Pharao Hophrea kynge of Egipte into the handes of his enemyes that seke after his lyfe: euen as I gaue zedekias the king of Iuda, into the handes of Nabuchodonosor kynge of Babilon hys enemye which sought after his lyfe.
Jer.45.1	These are the wordes that Ieremye the prophete spake vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah. after that he had wrytten these sermons in a boke at the mouth of Ieremy: In the fourth yeare of Iehoakim the sonne of Iosias kynge of Iuda, sayinge.
Jer.45.2	Thus sayth the Lorde God of Israel vnto the, O Baruch.
Jer.45.3	In somoche as thou thoughtest thus, when thou wast writtyng, Wo is me, the Lorde hath geuen me sorowe vpon sorowe. I haue weryed my selfe with syghing, and haue founde no rest.
Jer.45.4	Therfore tell hym, O Ieremye, that the Lorde sayth thus: Beholde, the thing that I haue buylded, wyll I breake downe agayne and rote out the thinge that I haue planted: yee, this whole lande.

Jer.48.32	So will I mourne for the also, O Iazer and for the, O thou vineyarde of Sabamah. Thy vyne braunches shall come ouer the see, and the braunches of Iazer but vnto the see: the destroyer shall breake into thy haruest and grape gathering:

Jer.49.3	Hesebon shall mourne, for Ay shalbe roted out of the grounde, sayth the Lorde. The cityes of Rabah shall crye out, and gyrde them selues with sacke cloth: they shall mourne, Ꟶ runne about the walles: for theyr king shalbe led awaye presoner: yee, his prestes and princes with hym.

Jer.50.23	How happeneth it, that the hammer of the whole worlde is thus broken and brosed in sonder? Howe chaunceth it, that Babilon is become a wildernesse amonge the Heythen on thys maner?
Jer.50.24	I my selfe haue layed wayte for the, and thou art taken vnawares: art thou trapped and snared: for why? thou hast prouoked the Lorde vnto anger.
Jer.50.25	The Lorde hath opened his house of ordinaunce, Ꟶ brought forth the weapens of hys wrath. For the thynge that is done in the lande of the Chaldees, it is the Lorde of hostes worcke.
Jer.50.26	Come agaynste her, for this is her ende: breake vp her chestes: threshe her as ye thresh corne: destroye her, that nothing shalbe left.
Jer.50.27	Slaye all their myghtye souldyers, and put them to death. Woo be vnto them, for the daye and tyme of their visitatyon is at hande.
Jer.50.28	Me thynke I heare allready a crye, of them that be fled and escaped out of the lande of Babilon, which shewe in Sion the vengeaunce of the Lorde our God, the vengeaunce of his temple: yee, a voyce of them, that crye agaynste Babylon.
Jer.50.29	Call vp all the archers agaynst Babilon, pitche your tentes rounde about her, that none escape. Recompence her, as she hath deserued: and accordynge as she hath done, so deale with her agayne, for she hath set vp her selfe agaynst the Lorde, agaynst the holye one of Israel.
Jer.50.30	Therfore shall her yonge men fall downe in the stretes, and all her men of warre shalbe roted out in that daye, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.50.31	Beholde, I speake vnto the, O thou proude, sayth the Lorde God of hostes: for thy daye shall come, euen the tyme of thy visitation.
Jer.50.32	And the proude shall stomble and fall and no man shall helpe him vp. I wyll burne vp his cityes with fyer, and it shall consume all that is rounde about him.
Jer.50.33	Thus sayth the Lorde of hoostes: The children of Israel and Iuda suffer violence together. All they that haue them in captiuitie, kept them fast, and wyl not let them go,
Jer.50.34	but their auenger and redemer is mightye, whose name is the Lorde of hoostes: he shall mainteyne their cause, he shall make the lande shake, and iudge them that dwell therin, one with another.
Jer.50.35	The swearde shall come vpon the Chaldees, sayth the Lorde, vpon them that dwell in Babilon, vpon their princes, and vpon their wyse men.
Jer.50.36	The swearde vpon their sothsayers, as for those, they shall become fooles. The swearde vpon their worthies, so that they shall stande in feare.
Jer.50.37	The swearde vpon their horsmen and charettes, and vpon all the comon people that dwell vnder them: so that they shall all become lyke women. The swearde vpon their treasure, so that it shalbe stollen awaye.
Jer.50.38	A drougth vpon their waters, so that they shalbe dried vp. For the lande worshippeth ymages, and delyteth in straunge wondrefull thinges.
Jer.50.39	Therfore shall wylde beastes, lamia Ꟶ catte of mountaynes, and estryches dwell therin, for there shall neuer man dwell there, nether shall eny man haue his habitation there for euermore.
Jer.50.40	Like as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorre, with the cityes that laye ther aboute, sayth the Lorde. So shall no man dwell there also, nether shall eny man haue there his habitatyon.
Jer.50.41	Beholde, there shall come a people from the north with a greate bonde of men, and many kynges shall stande vp from the endes of the earthe.
Jer.50.42	They beare bowes and bucklers, cruell are they and vnmercyfull. Their voyce roareth like the raging see, they ryde vpon horsses, and come weapened to fyght agaynst the, O Babylon.
Jer.50.43	Assoone as the king of Babilon heareth tell of them, his handes shall waxe feable. Sorowe and heuynes shall come vpon him, as a woman trauelynge with chylde.
Jer.50.44	Beholde, lyke as the lyon commeth vp from the pleasaunt medowes of Iordane vnto the grene pastures of Ethan, so wyll I dryue them forth, and make them runne agaynst her. But whom shall I chose out: Ꟶ ordeyne to soch a thynge? For who is lyke me, or who will stryue wt me? or what shepherd maye stande agaynst me?
Jer.50.45	Therfore, heare the councell that the Lord hath geuen vpon Babilon, and the deuyce that he hath taken vpon the land of the Chaldees: The least among the people shall teare them in peces, and loke what pleasaunt thing they haue: they shall laye it waste.
Jer.50.46	The noyse at the wynnynge of Babylon shall moue the earth, and the crye shalbe heard amonge the Gentiles.
Jer.51.1	Thus hath the Lorde sayd: beholde, I wyll rayse vp a perlous wynde agaynst Babylon and her citezens, that beare euyll wyll agaynst me.
Jer.51.2	I wyll sende also into Babilon fanners, to fanne her out, and to destroye her lande: for in the daye of her trouble they shalbe aboute her on euery syde.
Jer.51.3	Moreouer, the Lorde hath sayde vnto the bowe men, and to them that clyme ouer the walles in brest plates. Ye shall not spare her yonge men: kyll downe all her host.
Jer.51.4	Thus the slayne shall fall downe in the lande of the Chaldees, and the wounded in the stretes.
Jer.51.5	As for Israel and Iuda, they shall not be forsaken of their God, of the Lorde of hostes for the holy one of Israel sake: no, though they haue fylled all their land full of synne.
Jer.51.6	Flye awaye from Babilon, euery man saue his lyfe, that ye be not roted out wt her wickednesse: for the tyme of the Lordes vengeaunce is come: yee, he shall reward her agayne.
Jer.51.7	Babylon hathe bene in the Lordes hande, a golden cuppe that maketh all landes droncken. Of her wyne haue all people droncken: therfore, are they out of theyr wittes.
Jer.51.8	But sodenly is Babylon fallen, Ꟶ destroyed. Mourne for her, brynge plasters for her woundes, yf she maye paraduenture be healed againe.
Jer.51.9	We wold haue made Babylon whole, saye they: but she is nott recouered. Therfore wyll we let her alone, and go euery man into his awne countreye. For her iudgment is come into heauen, Ꟶ is gone vp to the cloudes.
Jer.51.10	The Lord hathe brought forth our righteousnes. And therfore come on, we wyll shewe Sion the worcke of the Lorde oure God.
Jer.51.11	Make sharpe the arowes, and multiplye youre shyldes: for the Lorde shall rayse vp the sprete of the kinge of the Medees, which hath allready a desyre to destroye Babilon. This shalbe the vengeaunce of the Lord, and the vengeaunce of his temple.
Jer.51.12	Set vp tokens vpon the walles of Babilon: make youre watch stronge, sett youre watchmen in araye: yee, holde preuye watches: and yet for all that shall the Lorde go forth with the deuyce, which he hath taken vpon them that dwell in Babilon.
Jer.51.13	O thou that dwellest by the greate waters, O thou that hast so great treasure and riches, thyne ende is come, and the rekening of thy wynninges.
Jer.51.14	The Lorde of hoostes hath sworne by him selfe, that he wyll ouerwhelme the with men, lyke gresshoppers in nomber, which with a corage shall crie, alarum, alarum agaynst the.
Jer.51.15	Yee, euen the Lorde of hostes, that wt his power made the earth, wt hys wysdome prepared the rounde worlde, and with his discretion spred out the heauens.
Jer.51.16	Assone as he letteth his voyce be hearde, the waters in the ayre waxe fearce. He draweth vp the cloudes from the endes of the earth. He turneth the lightnynges to rayne, he bringeth the wyndes out of their secrete places.
Jer.51.17	If they be estemed by their wysdome, all men are become fooles. Confounded be all the casters of ymages: for the thing that they make is but disceate, and hath no breath.
Jer.51.18	Uayne is it and an erronyouse worke: and in the time of visitation it shall perishe.
Jer.51.19	Neuertheles, the porcion of Iacob is none soch: but he that made all thinges, whose name is the Lorde of hoostes, he is the rodde of his enheritaunce.
Jer.51.20	Thou hast bene myne hammer and weapens for warre: for with the haue I broken the people in peces: and with the haue I destroied kingdomes.
Jer.51.21	Thorow the I haue beaten to poulder horse and horseman: yee, the charettes Ꟶ soch as sat vpon them.
Jer.51.22	Thorowe the I haue broken man Ꟶ woman, olde Ꟶ yonge, bacheler Ꟶ mayden.
Jer.51.23	Thorowe the I haue destroyed the sheperde and his flocke, the husbandeman and his catell, the princes and the rulers.
Jer.51.24	Therfore wyll I reward the citye of Babilon Ꟶ all her citesins, the Chaldees wt all the euyll which they haue done vnto Sion: yee, that ye your selues shall se it, sayth the Lorde:
Jer.51.25	Beholde, I come vpon the, thou noysome hill, sayth the Lorde: thou that destroyest all landes: I wyll stretche oute my hande ouer the, and cast the downe from the stony rockes: and will make the a brent hill:
Jer.51.26	so that nether corner stones, ner pinacles, ner foundatyons of stones shalbe taken eny more out of the, but wast and desolate shalt thou lye for euermore, sayth the Lorde.
Jer.51.27	Set vp a token in the laude: blowe the trompettes amonge the Heythen: prouoke the nations agaynst her, call the kyngdomes of Ararat, Menni and Ascanes agaynst her. Set the prince agaynst her: bring as great a sorte of terrible horses against her: as yf they were gresshoppers.
Jer.51.28	Prepare agaynst them the people of the Meedes wt their kynges, prynces and all their chefe rulers: yee, Ꟶ the whole lande that is vnder hym.
Jer.51.29	The lande also shall shake and be afrayed when the deuice of the Lorde shall come forth agaynst Babylon: to make the lande of Babylon so waste, that no man shall dwell eny more therin.
Jer.51.30	The worthyes of Babylon shall leaue the batayll, and kepe them selues in stronge holdes, their strength hath fayled them, they shalbe lyke wemen. Theyr dwellynge places shalbe brent vp, theyr barres shalbe broken.
Jer.51.31	One purseuaunt shall mete another: yee, one poste shall come by another, to bring the kynge of Babylon tydinges: that his cytie is taken in on euery syde,
Jer.51.32	the foordes occupied, the fennes brent vp, and the soudiers sore afrayed.
Jer.51.33	For thus sayeth the Lorde of hoostes the God of Israel: the daughter of Babylon hath bene in her tyme lyke as a thresshyng floore, but shortly shal her haruest come.
Jer.51.34	Nabuchodonosor the kynge of Babylon hath deuoured Ꟶ destroyed me, he hath made me an empty vessell. He swalowed me vp lyke a dragon, and fylled his bely with my delycates: he hath cast me oute,
Jer.51.35	he hath taken my substaunce awaye, and the thinge that was left me hath he caried vnto Babylon, sayeth the daughter that dwelleth in Syon: yee, Ꟶ my bloude also vnto the Caldees, sayeth Ierusalem.
Jer.51.36	Therfore thus sayeth the Lorde: Beholde, I wyll defende thy cause, and auenge the: I wyll drincke vp her see, and drye vp her water sprynges.
Jer.51.37	Babylon shall become an hepe of stones a dwellinge place for dragons, a fearfulnes and wondrynge, because no man dwelleth there.
Jer.51.38	They shall roare together lyke lyons, and as the yonge lyons when they be angrye, so shall they bende them selues.
Jer.51.39	In theyr heate I shall gyue them a dyner and they shalbe droncken for ioye. Then shall they slepe an euerlastynge slepe, and neuer wake, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.51.40	I shall carye them downe to be slayne lyke shepe, lyke wethers and goates.
Jer.51.41	O, how was Sesach wonne? O, how was the glory of the whole lande taken? how happeneth it, that Babilon is so wondred at among the Heathen?
Jer.51.42	The see is rysen ouer Babylon, and hath couered her wt his greate waues.
Jer.51.43	Her cyties are layed waste the lande lyeth vnbuylded and voyde: it is a lande where no man dwelleth, and where no man trauaylleth thorowe.
Jer.51.44	Moreouer, I wyll viset Bel at Babylon: and the thynge that he hath swalowed vp, that same shall I plucke out of hys mouth. The Gentyls also shall runne nomore vnto hym, yee, and the walles of Babylon shall fall.
Jer.51.45	O my people, come out of Babylon, that euery man maye saue his lyfe, from the fearfull wrath of the Lorde.
Jer.51.46	Be not faynte herted, and feare not at euery rumoure that shalbe herde in the lande: for euery yeare bringeth new tydinges, Ꟶ in the yere folowynge newe tydinges, Ꟶ robbynge in the lande and Lorde vpon Lorde.
Jer.51.47	And lo, the tyme commeth, that I wyll viset the ymages of Babylon, Ꟶ the whole lande shalbe confounded: yee, and her slayne shall lye in the myddest of her.
Jer.51.48	Heauen Ꟶ earth with all that is therin, shall reioyce ouer Babilon, when the destroyers shall come vpon her from the North, sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.51.49	Lyke as Babilon hath beaten downe Ꟶ slayne many out of Israel, so shall there fall many, and be slayne in all her kyngdome.
Jer.51.50	Ye that haue escaped the sweard, haste you, stande not styll, remembre the Lorde a farre of, and thyncke vpon Ierusalem,
Jer.51.51	for we were ashamed to heare the blasphemyes: our faces were couered with shame, because the straunge aleauntes came into the Sanctuary of the Lorde.
Jer.51.52	Wherfore, beholde (sayeth the Lord) the tyme commeth, that I wyll viset the ymages of Babylon, and thorowe the whole land they shall mourne and fall.
Jer.51.53	Though Babylon clymed vp into heauen, and kepte her power an hye: yet shal I sende her destroyers sayeth the Lorde.
Jer.51.54	A pyteous cry shalbe hearde from Babilon, and a greate misery from the land of the Caldees,
Jer.51.55	when the Lorde destroyeth them and when he dryueth out the hye stomack Ꟶ proude boastynge, wherwith they haue bene as furious as the waues of greate water floudes, and made greate crakes with their wordes.
Jer.51.56	For the destroyers shall come vpon her (euen vpon Babylon) which shall take their worthyes, and breake their bowes: for God is disposed to auenge hym selfe vpon them, and sufficiently to recompence them.
Jer.51.57	Yee, (sayeth the Lorde.) I wyll make theyr princes, theyr wyse men, theyr chefe rulers, and all their worthyes, droncken: so that they shall slepe an euerlastynge slepe, and neuer wake. Thus sayeth the kynge, whose name is the Lorde of Hostes.
Jer.51.58	Moreouer, thus sayeth the Lorde of Hostes. The thycke wall of Babylon shalbe broken, and her hye gates shalbe brent vp. And the thynge that the Gentyles and the people haue wrought with greate trauayle and labour, shall come to naught and be consumed in the fyre.
Jer.51.59	This is the charge that Ieremy gaue vnto Saraiah the sonne of Neriah, the sonne of Maasiah, when he went towarde Babylon with zedekiah the kyng of Iuda, in the fourth yeare of hys raygne. Nowe thys Saraiah was a peaceable prynce.
Jer.51.60	Ieremy wrote in a booke all the misery that shulde come vpon Babylon, yee, and all these sermons that be wrytten agaynst Babylon,
Jer.51.61	and gaue Saraiah thys charge. When thou commest vnto Babilon, se that thou reade all these wordes,
Jer.51.62	and saye. O Lorde, thou art determined to rote out thys place, so that nether people ner catell shall dwell there eny more, but to lye waste for euer:
Jer.51.63	and when thou hast redde out the booke, bynde a stone to it, and cast it in the myddest of Euphrates,
Jer.51.64	and saye, Euen thus shall Babylon syncke, Ꟶ be thrust downe with the burthen of trouble, that I wyll brynge vpon her: so that she shall neuer come vp agayne. Thus farre are the preachynges of Ieremy.
Jer.52.1	zedekiah was one and .xx. yeare olde, when he was made kyng, and he raygned eleuen yeare in Ierusalem. His mothers name was Hamutall, Ieremyes daughter of lybna.
Jer.52.2	He lyued wyckedly before the Lorde euen as Iehoachin dyd.
Jer.52.3	For the Lorde was angry at Ierusalem and Iuda, so longe tyll he had cast them out of hys presence. And zedekiah fell from the kynge of Babilon.
Jer.52.4	But in the nynth yeare of hys raygne, In the tenth moneth, the tenth daye of the moneth it happened, that Nabuchodonosor the kyng of Babilon with all hys hooste came before Ierusalem, and beseged it, and made them bulworckes rounde aboute it.
Jer.52.5	And thys besegynge of the cytie endured vnto the eleuenth yeare of kyng zedekiah.
Jer.52.6	And in the fourth moneth, the .ix. daye of the moneth, there was so great honger in the cytie: that there were nomore vytayles for the people of the lande.
Jer.52.7	So all the soudiers brake awaye, and fled oute of the cytie by nyght thorowe the waye of the porte betwene the two walles vp the kynges garden. Nowe the Chaldees had compassed the cytie rounde aboute, yet went these men their waye towarde the wyldernes.
Jer.52.8	And so the Chaldees folowed vpon them, and toke zedekiah the kynge in the felde of Iericho, when his hoost was runne from hym:
Jer.52.9	So they caryed the kyng awaye prysoner to Reblath, vnto the kynge of Babylon in the lande of Hemath, where he gaue iudgement vpon hym.
Jer.52.10	The kynge of Babylon also caused zedekiahs sonnes to be slayne before his face, yee and put all the prynces of Iuda to death at Reblath.
Jer.52.11	Moreouer, he put out the eyes of zedekiah, caused him to be bounde with two cheynes, to be caried vnto Babylon: and let hym lye in preson, tyll he dyed.
Jer.52.12	Nowe the tenth daye of the fyfth moneth in the nynth yeare of Nabuchodonosor kynge of Babilon, Nabusaradan the chefe captayne and the kynge of Babylons seruauntes came vnto Ierusalem,
Jer.52.13	and brent vp the house of the Lorde. He brent vp also the kynges palace, all the houses and all the gorgeous buyldynges in Ierusalem.
Jer.52.14	And the whole hoost of the Chaldees that were with the chefe captayne, brake downe all the walles of Ierusalem rounde aboute.
Jer.52.15	As for the poore people and soch folke as yet was left in the cytie: which also were fallen to the kynge of Babylon, yee, and what people as yet remayned: Nabuzaradan the chefe captayne caried them awaye presoners.
Jer.52.16	But the poore people of the countre, dyd Nabuzaradan the chefe captayne leaue in the lande, to occupye the vyneardes and feldes.
Jer.52.17	The Chaldees also brake the brasen pyllers that were in the house of the Lorde, yee, the seate and the brasen lauer that was in the house of the Lorde: and caryed all the metall of them vnto Babylon.
Jer.52.18	They toke awaye also the Cauldrons, shouels, fleshehokes, sprynklers, spones, and all the brasen vessell that was occupied in the seruyce:
Jer.52.19	with the basens, colepannes, sprynklers, pottes, candelstyckes, spones, and cuppes: wherof some were of golde, and some of syluer.
Jer.52.20	The chefe captaine toke also the two pillers, the lauer, the twelue brasen bullockes that stode vnder the seate which kyng Salomon made in the house of the Lord: and all the vessell conteyned so moch metall, that it myght not be weyed.
Jer.52.21	For euery piller was eyghtene cubytes hye: and the rope that went aboute it, was twelue cubytes, Ꟶ foure fyngers thycke and rounde.
Jer.52.22	Nowe vpon the rope were brasen knoppes, and euery knoppe was fyue cubytes hye: and vpon the knoppes were whopes, and pomgranates rounde about of cleane brasse:
Jer.52.23	After thys maner were both the pylers fashyoned wt the pomgranates, wherof there were an hundred and .xcvi. which hanged vpon the whoopes rounde about.
Jer.52.24	The chefe captaine also toke Sariah the hie preste, and Sophoniah that was chefe nexte hym, and the thre kepers of the treasury.
Jer.52.25	He toke oute of the cytie a chamberlayne which was a captayne of the souldyers, and seuen men that were the kynges seruauntes, which were founde in the cytie: and Sepher a captayne that vsed to muster the men of warre, with threscore men of the countre that were taken in the cytie.
Jer.52.26	These Nabuzaradan the chefe captayne toke, and caried them to the kynge of Babylon vnto Reblath:
Jer.52.27	and the kyng of Babylon caused them to be put to death at Reblath in the lande of Hemath. And thus Iuda was ledde awaye captiue, oute of hys awne lande.
Jer.52.28	This is the summe of the people, whom Nabuchodonosor ledde awaye captiue. In the seuenth yeare of hys raygne, he caried awaye of the Iewes, thre thousand and thre and twenty.
Jer.52.29	In the .xviii. yeare Nabuchodonosor caryed awaye from Ierusalem eyght hundreth thirty and two personnes.
Jer.52.30	In the .xxiii. yeare of Nabuchodonosor Nabuzaradan the chefe captayne, toke awaye seuen hundreth fourty and fyue Iewes presoners. The whole summe of all the presoners, is foure thousande and syxe hundreth.
Jer.52.31	In the .xxxvii. yeare after that Iehoachin the kynge of Iuda was caryed awaye in the .xxv. daye of the .xii. moneth, Euilmerodach kynge of Babylon (the same yeare that he reygned) gaue Iehoachin the kyng of Iuda hys pardon, and let hym out of preson,
Jer.52.32	and spake louyngly to him. And sett his trone aboue the trones of the other kynges that were with hym in Babylon.
Jer.52.33	He chaunged also the clothes of his preson, yee, and he dyd eate wt hym all his lyfe longe.
Jer.52.34	And he had a continuall lyuyng geuen him of the kynge of Babylon, euery daye a certayne thynge alowed him all the dayes of hys lyfe, vntyll he dyed.
