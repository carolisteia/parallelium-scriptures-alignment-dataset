Jude.0.0	¶ The Epistle of Saynct Iude.
Jude.1.1	Iudas the seruaunt of Iesus Christ the brother of Iames. To them which are called, and sanctifyed in God the father, and preserued in Iesu Christ.
Jude.1.2	Mercy vnto you and peace and loue be multiplyed.
Jude.1.3	Beloued, when I gaue all dyligence to wryte vnto you of the commen saluacyon, it was nedeful for me to write vnto you, to exhorte you, that ye shuld contynually laboure in the fayth, which was once geuen vnto the saynctes.
Jude.1.4	For ther are certayne vngodly men craftely crept in, of which it was written afore tyme vnto such iudgement. They turne the grace of oure God vnto wantannes, and denye God (which is the onely Lorde) and oure Lorde Iesus Christ.
Jude.1.5	My mynde is therfore to put you in remembraunce, for as moche as ye once knowe this, how that the Lorde (after that he had delyuered the people out of Egypt) destroyed them which after warde beleued not.
Jude.1.6	The angels also which kept not their fyrst estate, but lefte their awne habitacion, he hath reserued in euerlastynge chaynes vnder darcknes vnto the iudgement of the greate daye
Jude.1.7	euen as Sodome Ꟶ Gomore, and the cytyes aboute them (which in lyke maner defyled them selues with fornicacyon, and folowed straunge flesshe) are set forth for an ensample, Ꟶ suffre the payne of eternall fyre.
Jude.1.8	Lykewyse, these beyng disceaued by dreames, defile the flesshe, despise rulars Ꟶ speake euyll of them that are in aucthorite.
Jude.1.9	Yet Michael the archangell when he stroue agaynst the deuyll, Ꟶ disputed about the body, of Moses, durst not geue raylinge sentence, but sayde, the Lorde rebuke the.
Jude.1.10	But these speake euyll of those thynges whych they knowe not: and what thynges they knowe naturaly (as beastes which are wythout reason) in those thinges they corrupte them selues.
Jude.1.11	Wo be vnto them, for they haue folowed the waye of Cain, Ꟶ are vtterly geuen to the erroure of Balam for lukers sake Ꟶ perisshe in the treason of Core.
Jude.1.12	These are spottes which of your kidnes feast together, wt out feare, lyuinge lawlesse, and after ther awne pleasure. Cloudes they are with out water, caryed about of windes, trees wt out frute at geatheringe time withered, twyse deed, Ꟶ plucked vp by the rotes.
Jude.1.13	They are the ragynge waues of the see, fomynge out their awne shame. They are wandrynge sterres, to whom is reserued the myst of darcknes for euer.
Jude.1.14	Enoch the seuenth from Adam prophesyed before of such, sayinge. Beholde, the Lord shall come with thousandes of saynctes,
Jude.1.15	to geue iudgement agaynst all men, Ꟶ to rebuke all that are vngodly amonge them of all their vngodly dedes, which they haue vngodly committed, and of all their cruell speakynges, which vngodly synners haue spoken agaynst hym.
Jude.1.16	These are murmurers, complayners, walkyng after their awne lustes, whose mouthes speake proude thinges. They haue men in greate reuerence because of aduantage.
Jude.1.17	But ye beloued, remember the wordes which were spoken before of the Apostles of oure Lord Iesu Christ,
Jude.1.18	how that they tolde you that there shuld be begylers in the last tyme, which shuld walke after their awne vngodly lustes.
Jude.1.19	These are makers of sectes, fleshlye, hauynge no sprete.
Jude.1.20	But ye derlye beloued, edifye youre selues in your most holy fayth, prayinge in the holy goost,
Jude.1.21	and kepe your selues in the loue of God, lokynge for the mercy of oure Lord Iesus Christ, vnto eternall lyfe.
Jude.1.22	And haue compassion of some, separatinge them,
Jude.1.23	and other saue with feare, pullinge them out of the fyre and hate the fylthy vesture of the fleshe.
Jude.1.24	Unto him that is able to kepe you fre from synne, Ꟶ to present you fautlesse before the presence of his glory wt ioye
Jude.1.25	to God oure sauyour: which onely is wyse be glory, maiestye, dominion, and power, now and euer. Amen.
