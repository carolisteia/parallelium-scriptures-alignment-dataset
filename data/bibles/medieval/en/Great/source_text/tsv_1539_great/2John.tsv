2John.0.0	¶ The seconde epistle of Saynct Iohn.
2John.1.1	The elder to the electe lady and her children, whom I loue in the trueth: and not I onely, but also all that haue knowen the trueth
2John.1.2	for the truthes sake whych dwelleth in vs, and shalbe in vs for euer.
2John.1.3	With vs shall be grace, mercye, Ꟶ peace from God the father Ꟶ from the lord Iesus Christ the sonne of the father, in trueth Ꟶ loue.
2John.1.4	I reioysed greatly, that I founde of thy children walkinge in trueth, as we haue receaued a commaundement of the father.
2John.1.5	And now beseche I the lady, not as though I wrote a new commaundement vnto the, but that same which we haue had from the beginnynge, that we shuld loue one another.
2John.1.6	And this is the loue, that we shulde walke after hys commaundement. This commaundement is (that as ye haue hearde from the beginnynge) ye shuld walke in it.
2John.1.7	For many deceauers are entred into the worlde, whych confesse not that Iesus Christ is come in the fleshe. This is a deceauer and an Antichrist.
2John.1.8	Loke on your selues that we loose not that we haue wrought: but that we maye haue ful rewarde.
2John.1.9	Whosoeuer transgresseth Ꟶ bydeth not in the doctryne of Christ, hath not God. He that endureth in the doctrine of Christ, hath both the father Ꟶ the sonne.
2John.1.10	If ther come eny vnto you, Ꟶ bringe not this learninge, him receaue not to house: nether byd him God spede.
2John.1.11	For he that byddeth him God spede, is partaker of hys euyl dedes.
2John.1.12	I had many thynges to wryte vnto you, neuerthelesse I wolde not wryte wt paper and ynke: but I trust to come vnto you, Ꟶ speake wt you mouth to mouth, that oure ioye maye be full:
2John.1.13	the sonnes of thy electe sister grete the. Amen.
